When knitting an R Markdown document after the first time, errors may sometimes appear. Three tips are recommended below.

## 1. Close PDF reader window

When the document is knitted through the 'Knit' button, a PDF reader window opens to present the result. Closing this window can help resolve errors.

## 2. Delete service files

Every time the Rmd is knitted, some service files are created. Some of these files have the '.tex' extension (e.g., index.tex, Appendix-B.tex), whereas others do not (e.g., index.log, ZHJhZnQtYXBhLlJtZA==.Rmd, index.synctex.gz). Deleting these files can help resolve errors (see a [possible function](/2021/avoiding-knitting-errors-in-r-markdown-using-knit-deleting-service-files/)).

## 3. Delete code chunks related to the appendices

When knitting [papaja](https://github.com/crsh/papaja) documents containing any appendices, some code chunks related to the appendices will automatically appear at the end of the primary Rmd file---e.g.:

````
`r ''````{r echo = FALSE, results = 'asis', cache = FALSE}
papaja::render_appendix('Appendix-A.Rmd')
```
````

Normally, these code chunks are automatically removed as the knitting finishes. However, if the chunks remain in place, deleting them manually can help resolve errors.
