This blog post does not provide a complete overview of the atmosphere at university or in academia, where I think that fairness is far more common than discrimination. Let's keep up the good work, and be mindful of the rest.
</div>
<p>There is discrimination at European universities and in the corresponding academia. Minorities are too often oppressed and abused through the use of casual remarks, concerted attacks, unequal respect towards different groups, unfair hiring decisions, and other negligent behaviours. Professional and personal negligence is the reason why this discrimination is tolerated and condoned by staff of higher authority. Cases of discrimination are not normally shared by the universities, but they are sometimes registered on the websites of student unions, other student forums, or in the press.</p>
<p>Discrimination cases would be unsurprising in some big-money industries. At university, on the contrary, they are striking&mdash;first, because there are mechanisms to tackle and resolve them (however rigged they will be sometimes); second, because the other conditions of the job&mdash;notably, the salary&mdash;do not compensate for the negligence in the social sphere (even if there are many applicants for a single post in academia).</p>
<h2 id="homo-homini-lupus"><em>Homo homini lupus</em></h2>
<p>Xenophobia is one of the types of discrimination that sometimes crop up in halls of residence, departments, panels, committees, offices. Xenophobia exists where you are now, as it does where you come from. It is intrinsic to human societies (see Hinton, 2017). In society at large, who doesn&rsquo;t know the way in which different nationalities are ranked in a certain place? The specifics of these hierarchies vary across regions and individuals (thank goodness); and yet, xenophobia always tends to be underlain by an unfair, puny spirit.</p>
<h3 id="hierarchies-among-nationalities">Hierarchies among nationalities</h3>
<p>In society at large, the locals tend to be first. Through many everyday tricks, the locals often ensure that immigrants remain second to them. We must all remember that more people should not mean more rights. Each person is a person.</p>
<p>The first rank of immigrants is formed of one or two nationalities, smiled at by the fortune of historical or cultural ties. The second rank of immigrants is that of merely-tolerated nationalities. The third rank is formed of immigrants who are despised due to historical, political, cultural factors.</p>
<p>Sadly and dangerously enough, in competitive or onerous circumstances (<em>when is that not the case, though!</em>), <em>homo homini lupus est</em> (people are wolves unto others). Discrimination breaks loose (Abbink, &amp; Harris, 2019; Meiring et al., 2014; Mendes &amp; Koslov, 2013). Ominous, historical references are unnecessary. A hundred, or few hundred, years is very little time: it&rsquo;s <em>yesterday</em>.</p>
<h2 id="policies">Policies</h2>
<p>Policy statements are increasingly popular, and they give reasons for hope. For instance, the employment webpage of Duke University reads (on 21st July 2021; <a href="https://hr.duke.edu/policies/diversity/eeo):">https://hr.duke.edu/policies/diversity/eeo):</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Duke University prohibits discrimination and harassment, and provides equal employment opportunity without regard to an individual&rsquo;s age, color, disability, gender, gender expression, gender identity, genetic information, national origin, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or veteran status.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such statements, if indeed observed by the employees, constitute historical&mdash;why, historic!&mdash;changes. They should be celebrated, applauded&mdash;even if they simply adhere to fundamental, human rights.</p>
<h2 id="dealing-with-discrimination">Dealing with discrimination</h2>
<p>Discrimination takes many forms. Accordingly, surviving and confronting it requires various approaches. Stoicism, bravery, protection and ingenuity are all valuable against the xenophobia that lurks, and occasionally bites, in halls of residence, informal meetings, committees, offices, and decisions at universities across Europe. Inspiration for such approaches can be found in many places&mdash;even in popular literature. For instance, Harper Lee&rsquo;s <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em> contains a passage in which a lawyer is mobbed by nostalgic townspeople who do not want a Black citizen to be treated as a human. The strategies for the defence from the lynch mob span from the lawyer&rsquo;s stoicism to his son&rsquo;s adolescent bravery, and from the invisible protection by an ally to the disarming ingenuity of the lawyer&rsquo;s eight-year-old daughter, who finds one of her neighbours in the mob.</p>
<h3 id="collection-and-presentation-of-evidence">Collection and presentation of evidence</h3>
<p>Ironically, complaint cases are sometimes initiated by those who have exerted discrimination. If you receive a complaint and you feel you have been discriminated against before or through the complaint, it is important to note this in your response.</p>
<p>The discrimination can be well described by means of an extensive document that recounts every relevant episode, with the applicable evidence being attached. Don&rsquo;t fret about <em>reading time</em>: the larger the document, the better.</p>
<p>Name it! Discrimination has precise names&mdash;for instance, <em>xenophobia</em>&mdash;, which must be used where relevant and necessary. People know the meaning: perpetrators are likely know it, and so will the authorities or mediators who are in charge of resolving the case. Whether these people like the word to be used or not is their own problem, not yours. Nonetheless, names are just that&mdash;labels. Another label for many common cases at university is &lsquo;unfairness&rsquo;. It is less specific but often more objective.</p>
<p>As an example, this year I was bullied by some of my flatmates. This bullying was finally underscored when they submitted false accusations about me to the Graduate College Accommodation Office at Lancaster University. The latter office initially embraced and acted upon these accusations. The College would not initially allow me to receive and respond in writing. They preferred a live meeting. As I argued, a written procedure would cause less stress, allow less bias, and allow a more accurate registration of every input for future reference. Finally, it required a 36-page response from me and a one-hour disciplinary hearing for me to motivate the way in which some of my flatmates had bullied me throughout the year, presumably due to legitimate differences in the way we were each concerned about the Covid-19 pandemic, along with differences in academic stage, age, nationality and physical appearance. I was acquitted on all accusations.</p>
<p>It is important to express one&rsquo;s feeling of unfairness. I did so in an email to the College after the resolution (private information replaced with asterisks).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>The Dean has produced a resolution to the disciplinary hearing that was organised due to complaints from some of my flatmates. This resolution considers my flatmates' complaints as well as the 36-page response that I submitted and the one-hour hearing that finally took place. In the resolution, I was acquitted of all three alleged violations (my response to the summons and the Dean&rsquo;s resolution are attached to the present email).</p>
<p>As part of a fair procedure, I received documents that reflected my flatmates' complaints, as well as the treatment of those complaints from the Graduate Accommodation Office. I would be grateful for your consideration of my views on the role of the Graduate Accommodation Office.</p>
<p><strong>Biased treatment of accusations</strong></p>
<p>I have considered the response from the Graduate Accommodation Office as the complaints were raised, and until I was summoned to a disciplinary hearing. In my view, the Graduate Accommodation Office failed to demonstrate enough impartiality, which resulted in unfairness towards me. The claims made by some of my flatmates via email were acted upon by the Accommodation Office without an important consideration&ndash;namely, that the accusations could be deliberately false or inaccurate. Indeed, the accusations happened to be so, as I extensively argued in my response to the summons by providing detailed descriptions of the events and documentary evidence.</p>
<p>Disappointingly, the embracement of my flatmates' accusations by the Graduate Accommodation Office contrasts with the caution that is rightly applied when one calls the porters. I have sometimes called over the past three years regarding residents smoking indoors. Every time, they made me aware of the need for them to catch any students as they are smoking indoors. In the absence of the witnessing by the porters, the students can only be informed about the complaint made, but no action can be taken against them. This is a correct precaution against any false or misinformed accusations. In contrast, I think that the Graduate Accommodation Office, in some of their emails with some of my flatmates, embraced the accusations on a one-sided manner, and finally passed on these accusations to the Dean without having had any input from me about the veracity thereof.</p>
<p><strong>Biased provision of evidence</strong></p>
<p>Among the documents included in the disciplinary case, the Graduate Accommodation Office included a complaint that I had raised regarding the persistent failures to prevent a Covid-19 infection by my flatmates and by the housekeeper. My complaint should by no means have been mixed with the complaints against me. Its inclusion is a demonstration of the bias with which I was treated.</p>
<p><strong>Legitimate differences across flatmates contributing to discrimination</strong></p>
<p>I think that the biased response from the response from the Graduate Accommodation Office failed to consider the legitimate differences across the residents in these flats. The Graduate Accommodation Office know (as indeed they should) that the seven-person flats in this college are bound to include residents who are legitimately different from each other. In my flat this year, for instance, we have had important differences regarding academic stage, age and country of origin.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Academic stage: five master&rsquo;s students, one first-year PhD student and one third-year PhD student (I am the latter one).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Age: all my flatmates are under ***, whereas I am ***.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Country of origin: three ***, one ***, one ***, one *** and one *** (I am the latter one).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These differences must always be considered, as they can contribute to ingroup-outgroup bias in flats. Some of this bias could stem from xenophobia. Unfortunately, Lancaster University has had infamous cases of xenophobia in the past (<a href="https://scan.lancastersu.co.uk/2013/05/27/editorial-anonymous-bullying-on-facebook-groups-is-pure-cowardice/)">https://scan.lancastersu.co.uk/2013/05/27/editorial-anonymous-bullying-on-facebook-groups-is-pure-cowardice/)</a>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, would you please consider the following remarks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I think that the treatment of my flatmates' complaints was unfair and biased against me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think my flatmates aimed to have me expelled from the flat. Their spite was due to me being the only one who has been properly concerned about the virus in this flat, and due to the legitimate differences that existed between me and my flatmates regarding academic stage, age and country of origin, as listed above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think that this case demonstrates that it is extremely harmful to embrace and act upon accusations in a one-sided manner, as it can result in discrimination. The biased response from the Graduate Accommodation Office has instilled a fear from false accusations in me. As a result, I feel that henceforth I will have to monitor whether I or other residents are discriminated against by the Graduate Accommodation Office.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope that the Graduate Accommodation Office can acknowledge my experience of the present issue, and consider it to allow a fair treatment towards every resident in the future. As such, henceforth, I will consider the present email as an integral part of this process, and I hope that the Graduate Accommodation Office does too.</p>
<p>Thank you for your attention,</p>
<p>Pablo</p>

<h3 id="ceaseless-awareness">Ceaseless awareness</h3>
<p>Lobbying, whether we like it or not, is one of the necessary ways to confront this plight. So, talk about it. Make sure that other potential targets of it know that it is not fair, that they should not have to put up with it, and that they might be able to confront it in one way or another. Ceaseless awareness will help those who exert discrimination, too, as arguably, they are often unaware of their own act.</p>
<h4 id="the-internet">The internet</h4>
<p>The creation of awareness does not have to fully depend on close relationships. Email and social media allow safe activity where anonymity is necessary.</p>
<h2 id="take-home-message">Take-home message</h2>
<p>If you have suffered discrimination, or you are a potential target for it, please ensure that you are aware of this plague. Regardless of the rank that a given type of discrimination occupies in the social agenda (be that fair or wise, or very much otherwise), discrimination should not be tolerated by the people who suffer or witness it. In addition to being unethical, discrimination breaches human and fundamental rights, national laws and institutional rules.</p>
<p>If you are not a target but you think it is humane to act as an ally against discrimination, please try to confront it if you witness it, and to contribute to a widespread awareness.</p>
