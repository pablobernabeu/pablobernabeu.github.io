            <p id="abstract-p1">Linguistic relativity is the influence of language on other
                    realms of cognition. For instance, the way movement is expressed in a person’s
                    native language may influence how they perceive movement. Motion event encoding
                    (MEE) is usually framed as a typological dichotomy.
                        <span class="jp-italic">Path-in-verb</span> languages tend to encode path information
                    within the verb (e.g., ‘leave’), whereas <span class="jp-italic">manner-in-verb</span>
                    languages encode manner (e.g., ‘jump’). The results of MEE-based linguistic
                    relativity experiments range from no effect to effects on verbal and nonverbal
                    cognition. Seeking a more definitive conclusion, we propose linguistic and
                    experimental enhancements. First, we examine state-of-the-art typology,
                    suggesting how a recent MEE classification across twenty languages (<span class="xref">

                  </span>
               </span>) may enable more powerful
                    analyses. Second, we review procedural challenges such as the influence of
                    verbal thought and second-guessing in experiments. To tackle these challenges,
                    we propose distinguishing verbal and nonverbal subgroups, and having enough
                    filler items. Finally we exemplify this in an experimental design."
