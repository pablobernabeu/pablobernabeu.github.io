Frequentist and Bayesian statistics are sometimes regarded as fundamentally different philosophies. Indeed, can both methods qualify as philosophies, or is one of them just a pointless ritual? Is frequentist statistics about $p$ values only? Are frequentist estimates diametrically opposed to Bayesian posterior distributions? Are confidence intervals and credible intervals irreconcilable? Will R crash if [`lmerTest`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lmerTest/lmerTest.pdf) and [`brms`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brms/brms.pdf) are simultaneously loaded? If only we could fit frequentist and Bayesian models to the same data and plot the results together, we might get a glimpse into these puzzles.

All the analyses shown below can be reproduced using the materials at https://osf.io/gt5uf. The combination of frequentist and Bayesian estimates in the same plot is achieved using the following custom function from [Bernabeu (2022)](/publication/pablo-bernabeu-2022-phd-thesis). 


### Visualising frequentist and Bayesian estimates in one plot

Both frequentist and Bayesian statistics offer the options of hypothesis testing and parameter estimation (Cumming, 2014; Kruschke & Liddell, 2018; Rouder et al., 2018; Schmalz et al., 2022; Tendeiro & Kiers, 2019, 2022; van Ravenzwaaij & Wagenmakers, 2022). In the statistical analyses conducted by Bernabeu (2022), hypothesis testing was performed within the frequentist framework, whereas parameter estimation was performed within both the frequentist and the Bayesian frameworks (for other examples of the *estimation* approach, see Milek et al., 2018; Pregla et al., 2021; Rodr√≠guez-Ferreiro et al., 2020).

Frequentist and Bayesian estimates are not so polar opposites, are they? What is more, the larger differences between some estimates are the result of the priors that were set on the corresponding effects (shown below). 

<script src="https://emgithub.com/embed-v2.js?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fpablobernabeu%2Flanguage-sensorimotor-simulation-PhD-thesis%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fsemanticpriming%2Fbayesian_analysis%2Fsemanticpriming_brms_weaklyinformativepriors_exgaussian.R%23L16-L35&style=a11y-dark&type=code&showLineNumbers=on&showFileMeta=on&showCopy=on&fetchFromJsDelivr=on"></script>

In contrast, the Bayesian estimates for the effects that had less-informative priors were virtually identical to the estimates produced by the frequentist model.

Now it's time to consider in earnest: 

> Is frequentist statistics about $p$ values only? Are frequentist estimates diametrically opposed to Bayesian posterior distributions? Are confidence intervals and credible intervals irreconcilable? Will R crash if [`lmerTest`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lmerTest/lmerTest.pdf) and [`brms`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brms/brms.pdf) are simultaneously loaded?


### Session info

If you encounter any blockers while reproducing the above analyses using the materials at https://osf.io/gt5uf, my current session info may be useful. For instance, the legend of the plot may not show if the latest versions of the `ggplot2` and the `tidyverse` packages are used. Instead, `ggplot2 3.3.5` and `tidyverse 1.3.1` should be installed using `install_version('ggplot2', '3.3.5')` and `install_version('tidyverse', '1.3.1')`.

```{r}
