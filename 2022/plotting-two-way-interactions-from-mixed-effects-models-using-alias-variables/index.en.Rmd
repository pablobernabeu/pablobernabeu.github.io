Whereas the direction of main effects can be interpreted from the sign of the estimate, the interpretation of interaction effects often requires plots. This task is facilitated by the R package [`sjPlot`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sjPlot/sjPlot.pdf) (Lüdecke, 2022). In Bernabeu (2022), the sjPlot function called `plot_model` served as the basis for the creation of some [custom functions](https://github.com/pablobernabeu/language-sensorimotor-simulation-PhD-thesis/tree/main/R_functions). One of these functions is [`alias_interaction_plot`](https://github.com/pablobernabeu/language-sensorimotor-simulation-PhD-thesis/blob/main/R_functions/alias_interaction_plot.R), which allows the plotting of interactions between a continuous variable and a categorical variable. Importantly, the categorical variable is replaced with an alias variable. This feature allows the back-transformation of the categorical variable to facilitate the communication of the results, for instance, when the categorical variable was sum-coded, which has been recommended for mixed-effects models (Brauer & Curtin, 2018).

Below, we'll use the function with a model fitted using [`lmerTest`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lmerTest/lmerTest.pdf) (Kuznetsova et al., 2022), although the function also works with several other models (see [sjPlot manual](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sjPlot/sjPlot.pdf)). The plot can be reproduced using the materials at https://osf.io/gt5uf.
