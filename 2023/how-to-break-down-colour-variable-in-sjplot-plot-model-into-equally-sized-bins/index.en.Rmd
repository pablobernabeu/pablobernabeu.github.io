Whereas the direction of main effects can be interpreted from the sign of the estimate, the interpretation of interaction effects often requires plots. This task is facilitated by the R package [`sjPlot`](https://strengejacke.github.io/sjPlot). For instance, using the `plot_model` function, I plotted the interaction between two continuous variables. 

``` r
library(lme4)
#> Loading required package: Matrix
library(sjPlot)
#> Learn more about sjPlot with 'browseVignettes("sjPlot")'.
library(ggplot2)

theme_set(theme_sjplot())

# Create data partially based on code by Ben Bolker  
# from https://stackoverflow.com/a/38296264/7050882

set.seed(101)

spin = runif(800, 1, 24)

trait = rep(1:40, each = 20)

ID = rep(1:80, each = 10)

testdata <- data.frame(spin, trait, ID)

testdata$fatigue <- 
  testdata$spin * testdata$trait / 
  rnorm(800, mean = 6, sd = 2)

# Model
fit = lmer(fatigue ~ spin * trait + (1|ID),
           data = testdata, REML = TRUE)
#> boundary (singular) fit: see help('isSingular')

plot_model(fit, type = 'pred', terms = c('spin', 'trait'))
#> Warning: Ignoring unknown parameters: linewidth
```

However, I needed an extra feature, as sjPlot by default breaks down the colour (`fill`) variable into few levels that do not include the minimum or the maximum values in my variable. What I would like to do is to stratify the colour variable into equally-sized levels that include the minimum and the maximum values. 

Furthermore, in the legend, I would also like to display the number of levels of a grouping variable (`ID`) that are contained in each level of the colour variable.

Below is a solution using [custom functions called `deciles_interaction_plot` and `sextiles_interaction_plot`](/2022/plotting-two-way-interactions-from-mixed-effects-models-using-ten-or-six-bins).

``` r
library(lme4)
#> Loading required package: Matrix
library(sjPlot)
library(ggplot2)

theme_set(theme_sjplot())

# Create data partially based on code by Ben Bolker  
# from https://stackoverflow.com/a/38296264/7050882

set.seed(101)

spin = runif(800, 1, 24)

trait = rep(1:40, each = 20)

ID = rep(1:80, each = 10)

testdata <- data.frame(spin, trait, ID)

testdata$fatigue <- 
  testdata$spin * testdata$trait / 
  rnorm(800, mean = 6, sd = 2)

# Model
fit = lmer(fatigue ~ spin * trait + (1|ID),
           data = testdata, REML = TRUE)
#> boundary (singular) fit: see help('isSingular')

# plot_model(fit, type = 'pred', terms = c('spin', 'trait'))

# Binning the colour variable into ten levels (deciles)
