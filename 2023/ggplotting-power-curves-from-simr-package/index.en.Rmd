The R package 'simr' has greatly facilitated power analysis for mixed-effects models using Monte Carlo simulation (which involves running hundreds or thousands of tests under slight variations of the data). The `powerCurve` function is used to estimate the statistical power for various sample sizes in one go. Since the tests are run serially, they can take a VERY long time; approximately, the time it takes to run the model supplied once (say, a few hours) *times* the number of simulations (`nsim`, which should be higher than 200), and *times* the number of different sample sizes examined. While there isn't a built-in parallel method, the power curves for different sample sizes can be run separately, and the results can be progressively combined as each component finishes running (see [tutorial](/2021/parallelizing-simr-powercurve)). The power curves produced by `simr` are so good they deserve 'ggplot2' rendering. So, here's a function for it.

# A usage example

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

library(lme4)
library(simr)
library(ggplot2)

# Toy model with data from 'simr' package
fit = lmer(y ~ x + (x | g), data = simdata)

# Extend sample size of `g`
fit_extended_g = extend(fit, along = 'g', n = 12)

fit_powercurve = 
  powerCurve(fit_extended_g, fixed('x'), 
             along = 'g', breaks = c(4, 6, 8, 10, 12), 
             nsim = 50, seed = 123, progress = FALSE)

# Read in custom function to ggplot results from simr::powerCurve

source('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pablobernabeu/powercurvePlot/main/powercurvePlot.R')

powercurvePlot(fit_powercurve, number_x_axis_levels = 6) +
  
  # Change some defaults
  
  xlab("Number of levels in 'g'") +
  
  theme(plot.title = element_blank(),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 18), 
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 18), 
        axis.text = element_text(size = 17))

```
