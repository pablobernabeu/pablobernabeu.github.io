The [4authors-year-doi-url CSL style](https://github.com/pablobernabeu/4authors-year-doi-url/blob/main/4authors-year-doi-url) is designed to be as compact as possible---ideal for posters, slides and abstracts---while retaining the three most critical pieces of information for a reference: **who** (authors), **when** (year) and **where** (DOI/URL). 

## Features

- In-Text Citations: Simple, superscripted numbers (e.g., <sup>1</sup>, <sup>2</sup>, <sup>3</sup>).

- Bibliography:

  - Numeric: A numbered list, ordered by appearance in the text.

  - No Titles: Article and book titles are completely omitted to save space.

- Authors:

  - 1-3 Authors: All authors are listed.

  - 4+ Authors: Lists the first 3 authors, followed by an ellipsis (…) and the last author.

- Year: The publication year is included in parentheses.

- (DOI) URL: The reference ends with a DOI URL or another available URL.

## Examples

### In-Text Citation

We also recognise the many-to-many relationship between forms of knowledge and skills.<sup>2</sup> To build a predictive model, we will analyse interactions between reader-level factors and a comprehensive set of computationally-derived text variables.<sup>5–8</sup>
