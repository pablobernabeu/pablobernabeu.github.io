My CV is available.\nThe linguistic and sensorimotor bases of semantic processing: Variation across individuals, words and tasks Conceptual processing has been found to draw on two cognitive systems. One is a linguistic system, which is based on knowledge of words and the relations among them. The other is a sensorimotor system, which draws on our perceptual, motor and affective experience. These two systems contribute to conceptual processing in a sequential manner: the linguistic system is activated first, providing more superficial semantic information, with the sensorimotor system slower to reach peak activation, but providing more refined meaning. We know that the relative importance of each system is modulated by contextual factors (e.g., linguistic context, processing goals, cognitive resources). However, we know much less about how people’s individual cognitive capacities and experience (reading experience, reasoning ability) interact with these systems, which has become a central theme in my work.\nMuch evidence has been found in cognitive psychology for the role of linguistic systems (based on statistical regularities in how words co-occur in language) and sensorimotor systems (based on perceptual, motor, affective experience). The linguistic system is consistently linked to faster, more superficial processing, while the sensorimotor system is linked to slower, more cognitively demanding tasks (Connell \u0026amp; Lynott, 2013; Louwerse et al., 2015). Recent evidence suggests that individual differences, such as measures of reading experience (e.g., Pexman \u0026amp; Yap, 2018) and of sensorimotor experience (Beilock, et al., 2008; Vukovic \u0026amp; Williams, 2015), provide additional explanatory power for accounts of embodied cognition. For example, linguistic individual differences in vocabulary predict word recognition and information processing speed (Yap et al., 2012). Likewise, sensorimotor individual differences in spatial perspective-taking are also implicated in semantic processing, as participants who tend to naturally adopt an internal perspective in space are more likely to engage in perceptual simulation when reading, by identifying themselves as the protagonist (Vukovic \u0026amp; Williams, 2015).\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://pablobernabeu.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"After doing a research master's, I became a PhD student and graduate teaching assistant in Psychology at Lancaster University.

Over the past decades, LMMs have subsumed most of the General Linear Model, with a steady increase in popularity (Meteyard \u0026amp; Davies, 2020). Since their conception, LMMs have presented the challenge of model convergence. In essence, the issue of convergence boils down to the widespread tension between parsimony and completeness in data analysis. That is, on the one hand, a good model must allow an accurate, parsimonious analysis of each predictor, and thus, it must not be overfitted with too many parameters. Yet, on the other hand, the model must be complete enough to account for a sufficient amount of variation in the data. In LMMs, any predictors that entail non-independent observations (also known as repeated measures) will normally bring both fixed and random effects into the model. Where a few of these predictors coexist, models often struggle to find enough information in the data to account for every predictor—and especially, for every random effect. This difficulty translates into convergence warnings (Brauer \u0026amp; Curtin, 2018; Singmann \u0026amp; Kellen, 2019). In this article, I review the issue of convergence before presenting a new plotting function in R that facilitates the diagnosis of convergence by visualising the fixed effects fitted by different optimization algorithms (also dubbed optimizers).\nCompleteness versus parsimony Both fixed and random effects comprise intercepts and slopes. The pressure exerted by each of those types of effects on the model is determined by the number of data points involved by each. First, slopes are more demanding than intercepts, as they involve a (far) larger number of data points. Second, random effects are more demanding than fixed effects, as random effects entail the number of estimates required for fixed effects times the number of levels in the grouping factor. As a result, on the most lenient end of the scale lies the fixed intercept, and on the heaviest end lie the random slopes. Convergence warnings in LMMs are often due to the random slopes alone.\nSounds easy, then! Not inviting the random slopes to the party should solve the problem. Indeed, since random slopes involve the highest number of estimates by far, removing them does often remove convergence warnings. This, however, leads to a different problem. Surrendering the information provided by random slopes can result in the violation of the assumption of independence of observations. For years, the removal of random slopes due to convergence warnings was standard practice. Currently, in contrast, proposals increasingly consider other options, such as removing random effects if they do not significantly improve the fit of the model (Matuschek et al., 2017), and keeping the random slopes in the model in spite of the convergence warnings to safeguard the assumption of independence (see Table 17 in Brauer \u0026amp; Curtin, 2018; Singmann \u0026amp; Kellen, 2019).\n The multiple-optimizers sanity check from lme4::allFit() Framed within the drive to maintain random slopes wherever possible, the developers of the ‘lme4’ package propose a sanity check that uses a part of the ‘lme4’ engine called ‘optimizer’. Every model has a default optimizer, unless a specific one is chosen through control = lmerControl(optimizer = '...') (in lmer models) or control = glmerControl(optimizer = '...') (in glmer models). The seven widely-available optimizers are:\n bobyqa Nelder_Mead nlminbwrap nmkbw optimx.L-BFGS-B nloptwrap.NLOPT_LN_NELDERMEAD nloptwrap.NLOPT_LN_BOBYQA  To assess whether convergence warnings render the results invalid, or on the contrary, the results can be deemed valid in spite of the warnings, Bates et al. (2021) suggest refitting models affected by convergence warnings with a variety of optimizers. The authors argue that if the different optimizers produce practically-equivalent results, the results are valid. The allFit function from the ‘lme4’ package allows the refitting of models using a number of optimizers. To use the seven optimizers listed above, two extra packages must be installed: ‘dfoptim’ and ‘optimx’ (see lme4 manual). The output from allFit() contains several statistics on the fixed and the random effects fitted by each optimizer (see example).\n Plotting the fixed effects from allFit() Several R users have ventured into plotting the allFit() output but there is not a function in ‘lme4’ yet at the time of writing (Oct 2021). I have just developed a function that takes the output from allFit(), tidies it, selects the fixed effects and plots them using ‘ggplot2’. The function is shown below, and can be copied through the Copy Code button at the top right corner. It can be renamed by changing plot.fixef.allFit to another valid name.\n# Plot the results from the fixed effects produced by different optimizers. This function # takes the output from lme4::allFit(), tidies it, selects fixed effects and plots them. plot.fixef.allFit = function(allFit_output, # Set the same Y axis limits in every plot shared_y_axis_limits = TRUE, # Multiply Y axis limits by a factor (only # available if shared_y_axis_limits = TRUE) multiply_y_axis_limits = 1, # Number of decimal points decimal_points = NULL, # Select predictors select_predictors = NULL, # Number of rows nrow = NULL, # Y axis title y_title = \u0026#39;Fixed effect\u0026#39;, # Alignment of the Y axis title y_title_hjust = NULL, # Add number to the names of optimizers number_optimizers = TRUE, # Replace colon in interactions with x interaction_symbol_x = TRUE) { require(lme4) require(dplyr) require(reshape2) require(stringr) require(scales) require(ggplot2) require(ggtext) require(patchwork) library(Cairo) # Tidy allFit output # Extract fixed effects from the allFit() output allFit_fixef = summary(allFit_output)$fixef %\u0026gt;% # Select fixed effects in the allFit results reshape2::melt() %\u0026gt;% # Structure the output as a data frame rename(\u0026#39;Optimizer\u0026#39; = \u0026#39;Var1\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;fixed_effect\u0026#39; = \u0026#39;Var2\u0026#39;) # set informative names # If number_optimizers = TRUE, assign number to each optimizer and place it before its name if(number_optimizers == TRUE) { allFit_fixef$Optimizer = paste0(as.numeric(allFit_fixef$Optimizer), \u0026#39;. \u0026#39;, allFit_fixef$Optimizer) } # If select_predictors were supplied, select them along with the intercept (the latter required) if(!is.null(select_predictors)) { allFit_fixef = allFit_fixef %\u0026gt;% dplyr::filter(fixed_effect %in% c(\u0026#39;(Intercept)\u0026#39;, select_predictors)) } # Order variables allFit_fixef = allFit_fixef[, c(\u0026#39;Optimizer\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;fixed_effect\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;value\u0026#39;)] # PLOT.

It allows using the same Y axis limits (i.e., range) in all plots or, alternatively, using plot-specific limits. The parameter is TRUE by default to prevent overinterpretations of small differences across optimizers (see the first figure below). In contrast, when shared_y_axis_limits = FALSE, plot-specific limits are used, which results in a narrower range of values in the Y axis (see the second figure below). Since data points will span the entire Y axis in that case, any difference across optimizers—regardless of its relative importance—might be perceived as large, unless the specific range of values in each plot is noticed.\n  Use case Let’s test the function on a new analysis of the English Lexicon Project (Balota et al., 2007; Yap et al., 2012) that I’ve conducted for a forthcoming study.\n# Read in allFit() output m1_allFit_convergence = readRDS(\u0026#39;m1_allFit_convergence.rds\u0026#39;) # To select specific predictors, first return their names colnames(summary(m1_allFit_convergence)$fixef) ## [1] \u0026quot;(Intercept)\u0026quot; ## [2] \u0026quot;z_orthographic_Levenshtein_distance\u0026quot; ## [3] \u0026quot;z_word_concreteness\u0026quot; ## [4] \u0026quot;z_vocabulary_age\u0026quot; ## [5] \u0026quot;z_recoded_participant_gender\u0026quot; ## [6] \u0026quot;z_word_frequency\u0026quot; ## [7] \u0026quot;z_visual_rating\u0026quot; ## [8] \u0026quot;z_word_concreteness:z_vocabulary_age\u0026quot; ## [9] \u0026quot;z_word_concreteness:z_recoded_participant_gender\u0026quot; ## [10] \u0026quot;z_vocabulary_age:z_word_frequency\u0026quot; ## [11] \u0026quot;z_vocabulary_age:z_visual_rating\u0026quot; ## [12] \u0026quot;z_recoded_participant_gender:z_word_frequency\u0026quot; ## [13] \u0026quot;z_recoded_participant_gender:z_visual_rating\u0026quot; A subset of these effects is selected below using the argument select_predictors.

Yet, it is important to note that any interactions passed to select_predictors must have the colon, as that is the symbol present in the lme4::allFit() output.\nThe output of plot.fixef.allFit() is a ggplot2 object that can be stored for further use, as in the example below, in which new parameters are used.\nplot_m1_allFit_convergence = plot.fixef.allFit(m1_allFit_convergence, select_predictors = c(\u0026#39;z_vocabulary_age\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;z_vocabulary_age:z_word_frequency\u0026#39;), # Use plot-specific Y axis limits shared_y_axis_limits = FALSE, decimal_points = 7, # Move up Y axis title y_title_hjust = -11.8, y_title = \u0026#39;Fixed effect (\\u03B2)\u0026#39;) # \\u03B2 = beta letter # Modify aspect further using `ggplot2::theme()` plot_m1_allFit_convergence = plot_m1_allFit_convergence + theme(axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12)) ## Error in `merge_element()`: ## !

On the other hand, it would be inefficient to create a document that is very slow to run or very long. The context of the task will determine how how time-consuming and long the code in an Rmd file can be. For instance, one could decide that the knitting can take up to 15 minutes, and each code chunk can span up to 30 lines.\nSeveral methods can be used in each document to accommodate different types of code. Three methods are presented below, ordered from easier-to-reproduce to easier-to-knit.\nFor fast- and concise-enough code: Provide the original code in the Rmd file. The code is run as the document is knitted. Example:\n nrow(myData) For fast-enough but very long code: Store the code in a separate script and source it in the Rmd file. The code is run as the document is knitted. Example:\n source(\u0026#39;analysis/model_diagnostics.R\u0026#39;) For very slow and/or long code: Store the code in a separate script and run it prior to knitting the Rmd file, so that the output from the code (e.g., a model, a plot) is saved and can be read into the Rmd. Example:\n model_1 = readRDS(\u0026#39;results/model_1.rds\u0026#39;)  Importantly, even the third method allows the reproducibility of the code.

Here I suggest three ways for cutting down this time.\nWhere possible, use a high-performance (or high-end) computing cluster. This removes the need to use personal computers for these long jobs.\n In case you’re using the fixed() parameter of the powercurve function, and calculating the power for different effects, run these at the same time (‘in parallel’) on different machines, rather than one after another.\n Parallelize the breaks argument. The breaks argument of the powercurve function allows the calculation of power for different levels of the grouping factor passed to along. Some grouping factors are participant, trial and item. The breaks argument sets the different sample sizes for which power will be calculated. Parallelizing breaks is done by running each number of levels in a separate function. When each has been run and saved, they are combined to allow the plotting. This procedure is demonstrated below.\n  Parallelizing breaks Let’s do a minimal example using a toy lmer model. A power curve will be craeted for the fixed effect of x along different sample sizes of the grouping factor g.\nNotice that the six sections of the power curve below are serially arranged, one after another. In contrast, to enable parallel processing, each power curve would be placed in a single script, and they would all be run at the same time.\nAlthough the power curves below run in a few minutes, the settings that are often used (e.g., a larger model; fixed('x', 'sa') instead of fixed('x'); nsim = 500 instead of nsim = 50) take far longer. That is where parallel processing becomes useful.1\nlibrary(lme4) library(simr) # Toy model fm = lmer(y ~ x + (x | g), data = simdata) # Extend sample size of `g` fm_extended_g = extend(fm, along = \u0026#39;g\u0026#39;, n = 12) # Parallelize `breaks` by running each number of levels in a separate function. # 4 levels of g pwcurve_4g = powerCurve(fm_extended_g, fixed(\u0026#39;x\u0026#39;), along = \u0026#39;g\u0026#39;, breaks = 4, nsim = 50, seed = 123, # No progress bar progress = FALSE) # 6 levels of g pwcurve_6g = powerCurve(fm_extended_g, fixed(\u0026#39;x\u0026#39;), along = \u0026#39;g\u0026#39;, breaks = 6, nsim = 50, seed = 123, # No progress bar progress = FALSE) # 8 levels of g pwcurve_8g = powerCurve(fm_extended_g, fixed(\u0026#39;x\u0026#39;), along = \u0026#39;g\u0026#39;, breaks = 8, nsim = 50, seed = 123, # No progress bar progress = FALSE) # 10 levels of g pwcurve_10g = powerCurve(fm_extended_g, fixed(\u0026#39;x\u0026#39;), along = \u0026#39;g\u0026#39;, breaks = 10, nsim = 50, seed = 123, # No progress bar progress = FALSE) # 12 levels of g pwcurve_12g = powerCurve(fm_extended_g, fixed(\u0026#39;x\u0026#39;), along = \u0026#39;g\u0026#39;, breaks = 12, nsim = 50, seed = 123, # No progress bar progress = FALSE) \nHaving saved each section of the power curve, we must now combine them to be able to plot them together.\n# Create a destination object using any of the power curves above. all_pwcurve = pwcurve_4g # Combine results all_pwcurve$ps = c(pwcurve_4g$ps[1], pwcurve_6g$ps[1], pwcurve_8g$ps[1], pwcurve_10g$ps[1], pwcurve_12g$ps[1]) # Combine the different numbers of levels. all_pwcurve$xval = c(pwcurve_4g$nlevels, pwcurve_6g$nlevels, pwcurve_8g$nlevels, pwcurve_10g$nlevels, pwcurve_12g$nlevels) print(all_pwcurve) ## Power for predictor \u0026#39;x\u0026#39;, (95% confidence interval), ## by number of levels in g: ## 4: 46.00% (31.81, 60.68) -

Let's keep up the good work and be mindful of the rest.  There is discrimination at European universities and in the corresponding academia. Minorities are too often oppressed and abused through the use of casual remarks, concerted attacks, unequal respect towards different groups, unfair hiring decisions and other negligent behaviours. Professional and personal negligence is the reason why this discrimination is tolerated and condoned by staff of higher authority. Cases of discrimination are not normally shared by the universities, but they are sometimes registered on the websites of student unions, other student forums, or in the press. Discrimination must not be tolerated either at university or in academia. I hope this blog post provides some useful tips for dealing with discrimination from university students and staff alike.\nHomo homini lupus Xenophobia is one of the types of discrimination that sometimes crop up in halls of residence, departments, panels, committees, offices. Xenophobia exists where you are now, as it does where you come from. It is intrinsic to human societies (see Hinton, 2017). In society at large, who doesn't know the way in which different nationalities are ranked in a certain place? The specifics of these hierarchies vary across regions and individuals (thank goodness); and yet, xenophobia always tends to be underlain by an unfair, puny spirit.\nHierarchies among nationalities In society at large, the locals tend to be first. Some locals sometimes utilise official devices and everyday tricks to ensure that immigrants are second to them. We must all remember that more people should not mean more rights. Each person is a person.\nThe first rank of immigrants is formed of one or two nationalities, smiled at by the fortune of historical or cultural ties. The second rank of immigrants is that of merely-tolerated nationalities. The third rank is formed of immigrants who are despised due to historical, political, cultural factors.\nSadly and dangerously enough, in competitive or onerous circumstances (when is that not the case, though!), homo homini lupus est (people are wolves unto people). Then, discrimination breaks loose (Abbink, \u0026amp; Harris, 2019; Meiring et al., 2014; Mendes \u0026amp; Koslov, 2013).\nPolicies Policy statements are increasingly popular and they give reasons for hope. For instance, the employment webpage of Duke University reads (on 21st July 2021; https://hr.duke.edu/policies/diversity/eeo):\n Duke University prohibits discrimination and harassment, and provides equal employment opportunity without regard to an individual's age, color, disability, gender, gender expression, gender identity, genetic information, national origin, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or veteran status.\n Such statements, if indeed observed by the employees, constitute historical\u0026mdash;why, historic!\u0026mdash;changes. They should be celebrated, applauded\u0026mdash;even if they simply adhere to fundamental, human rights.\nDealing with discrimination Discrimination takes many forms. Accordingly, surviving and confronting it requires various approaches. Stoicism, bravery, protection and ingenuity are all valuable against the xenophobia that lurks, and occasionally bites, in halls of residence, informal meetings, committees, offices, and other settings at universities across Europe. Inspiration for such approaches can be found in many places\u0026mdash;even in popular literature. For instance, Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird contains a passage in which a lawyer is mobbed by nostalgic townspeople who do not want a Black citizen to be treated as a human. The strategies for the defence from the lynch mob span from the lawyer's stoicism to his son's adolescent bravery, and from the invisible protection offered by a witness to the disarming ingenuity of the lawyer's eight-year-old daughter, who spots one of her neighbours in the mob.\nCollection and presentation of evidence Ironically, complaint cases are sometimes initiated by those who have exerted discrimination. If you receive a complaint and you feel you have been discriminated against, whether before or through the said complaint, it is important to note this in your response.\nThe discrimination can be well described by producing an extensive document that recounts every relevant episode, with the applicable evidence being attached. Don't fret about reading time: the larger the document, the better.\nName it. Discrimination has precise names\u0026mdash;for instance, xenophobia\u0026mdash;, which must be used where relevant and necessary. People know the meaning: perpetrators are likely know it and so will the authorities or mediators who are in charge of resolving the case. Whether these people like the word to be used or not is their own problem, not yours. Nonetheless, more general, and often more objective, hypernyms are also available, such as \u0026lsquo;discrimination\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;unfairness\u0026rsquo;.\nCase study This year, I was bullied by some of my flatmates. This bullying was finally underscored when they submitted false accusations about me to the Graduate College Accommodation Office at Lancaster University. The latter office embraced and acted upon these accusations. As a result, a flat meeting was suggested by the Deanery. The Deanery would not initially allow me to receive information in writing and to respond likewise. On the contrary, they required a live meeting. As I repeatedly countered, I thought that a written procedure would cause less stress, yield less bias, and allow a more accurate registration of every input for future reference.\n It is due to three reasons that I would prefer working on the basis of a brief written report, to which I could also respond in writing. These reasons are:\n I think that the written mode helps remain more impartial than the oral mode. I think a written discussion would help in keeping a clear, written record of every part of the report. I think a written discussion causes less stress than an oral one.  I am hopeful that, having presented my preference for responding in writing to a written report, you may acknowledge my personal preference, and perhaps allow me to proceed in that way.\n A written discussion\u0026mdash;e.g., via email\u0026mdash; is a valuable option in situations that could be unfair or abusive.\nFinally, when I was presented with the necessary written information, I replied with a 36-page document, and participated in a one-hour disciplinary hearing. By those means, I described the way in which some of my flatmates had bullied me throughout the year, finally reinforced through the false accusations they had made. They had lied about their own behaviour, too, while they were at it.\nI think this bullying was motivated by the legitimate differences in the way we were each concerned about the Covid-19 pandemic, along with differences in academic stage, age, nationality and physical appearance. As a general rule, people tend to have difficulties to respect or tolerate others who are different from them. In the present instance, this difficulty drove my flatmates to submit false accusations about me while forgetting crucial information about their own behaviour. The time-consuming, 36-page response that I composed helped clarify the state of affairs. Upon a formal review, I was acquitted on all accusations.\nIt is important to express one's feeling of unfairness where it exists. I did so, following the Dean's resolution, through the email below, which I sent to the College (private information replaced with asterisks).\n Dear All,\nThe Dean has produced a resolution to the disciplinary hearing that was organised due to complaints from some of my flatmates. This resolution considers my flatmates\u0026rsquo; complaints as well as the 36-page response that I submitted and the one-hour hearing that finally took place. In the resolution, I was acquitted of all three alleged violations (my response to the summons and the Dean's resolution are attached to the present email).\nAs part of a fair procedure, I received documents that reflected my flatmates\u0026rsquo; complaints, as well as the treatment of those complaints from the Graduate Accommodation Office. I would be grateful for your consideration of my views on the role of the Graduate Accommodation Office.\nBiased treatment of accusations\nI have considered the response from the Graduate Accommodation Office as the complaints were raised, and until I was summoned to a disciplinary hearing. In my view, the Graduate Accommodation Office failed to demonstrate enough impartiality, which resulted in unfairness towards me. The claims made by some of my flatmates via email were acted upon by the Accommodation Office without an important consideration\u0026ndash;namely, that the accusations could be deliberately false or inaccurate. Indeed, the accusations happened to be so, as I extensively argued in my response to the summons by providing detailed descriptions of the events and documentary evidence.\nDisappointingly, the embracement of my flatmates\u0026rsquo; accusations by the Graduate Accommodation Office contrasts with the caution that is rightly applied when one calls the porters. I have sometimes called over the past three years regarding residents smoking indoors. Every time, they made me aware of the need for them to catch any students as they are smoking indoors. In the absence of the witnessing by the porters, the students can only be informed about the complaint made, but no action can be taken against them. This is a correct precaution against any false or misinformed accusations. In contrast, I think that the Graduate Accommodation Office, in some of their emails with some of my flatmates, embraced the accusations on a one-sided manner, and finally passed on these accusations to the Dean without having had any input from me about the veracity thereof.\nBiased provision of evidence\nAmong the documents included in the disciplinary case, the Graduate Accommodation Office included a complaint that I had raised regarding the persistent failures to prevent a Covid-19 infection by my flatmates and by the housekeeper. My complaint should by no means have been mixed with the complaints against me. Its inclusion is a demonstration of the bias with which I was treated.\nLegitimate differences across flatmates contributing to discrimination\nI think that the biased response from the response from the Graduate Accommodation Office failed to consider the legitimate differences across the residents in these flats. The Graduate Accommodation Office know (as indeed they should) that the seven-person flats in this college are bound to include residents who are legitimately different from each other. In my flat this year, for instance, we have had important differences regarding academic stage, age and country of origin.\n  Academic stage: five master's students, one first-year PhD student and one third-year PhD student (I am the latter one).\n  Age: all my flatmates are under ***, whereas I am ***.\n  Country of origin: three ***, one ***, one ***, one *** and one *** (I am the latter one).\n  These differences must always be considered, as they can contribute to ingroup-outgroup bias in flats. Some of this bias could stem from xenophobia. Unfortunately, Lancaster University has had infamous cases of xenophobia in the past (https://scan.lancastersu.co.uk/2013/05/27/editorial-anonymous-bullying-on-facebook-groups-is-pure-cowardice/).\nIn conclusion, would you please consider the following remarks:\n  I think that the treatment of my flatmates\u0026rsquo; complaints was unfair and biased against me.\n  I think my flatmates aimed to have me expelled from the flat. Their spite was due to me being the only one who has been properly concerned about the virus in this flat, and due to the legitimate differences that existed between me and my flatmates regarding academic stage, age and country of origin, as listed above.\n  I think that this case demonstrates that it is extremely harmful to embrace and act upon accusations in a one-sided manner, as it can result in discrimination. The biased response from the Graduate Accommodation Office has instilled a fear from false accusations in me. As a result, I feel that henceforth I will have to monitor whether I or other residents are discriminated against by the Graduate Accommodation Office.\n  I hope that the Graduate Accommodation Office can acknowledge my experience of the present issue, and consider it to allow a fair treatment towards every resident in the future. As such, henceforth, I will consider the present email as an integral part of this process, and I hope that the Graduate Accommodation Office does too.\nThank you for your attention,\nPablo\n When I had not received a reply within two weeks, I followed up with another email referring to details in the documents that were suggestive of a bias among the staff. This staff had followed directions from some of my flatmates without requesting my perspective on the issue, my side of things, my feedback, with the same degree of trust. Why? Why had they discriminated against me?\u0026mdash;I asked them. Did I not pay the same accommodation fees as the others? Was I not the same kind of a customer? This time, I did not limit my feedback to the Graduate College: I found it necessary to share my disappointment with some other services of the university as well.\n I sincerely believe that the Graduate College Accommodation Office and the Graduate College Deanery would benefit from some training in dealing with complaints fairly, efficiently and professionally. I believe such a training would benefit all students, especially those\u0026ndash;like myself\u0026ndash;who are more likely to be bullied by flatmates due to having a different profile (country of origin, physical appearance, academic requirements, leisure habits, etc.). My flatmates\u0026rsquo; bullying towards me began in the first week, when they blamed me for placing my food on shelves of the fridge which they had unilaterally chosen. They had assigned me a shelf\u0026mdash;one at the bottom of the fridge. Episodes extended throughout the year, as I extensively described in my 36-page response to the Dean's summons, which I can share with you if that were necessary for the revision of the conditions at Graduate College.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe present case has already robbed me of precious time. I wonder if this was part of the intention of some persons involved in this process. In any case, I hope this information will be helpful for the future. Discrimination must be confronted at this university. I pay the same accommodation fees and, logically, I deserve the same trust and care as the most beloved of residents.\n A design feature? Perhaps societies are discriminatory by design. As an illustration, a comment by John Bercow on the xenophobia that lurks in a large party provides an idea of the scale of the problem. Perhaps we are not doing enough about this. This insufficiency might explain, for instance, why the death of an innocent Slovak citizen in police custody at Charleroi Airport (Brussels, Belgium) was barely and poorly covered by the European media. In case that you tolerate graphic footage, please consider the unnecessary, illegal treatment given to Jozef Chovanec. Chovanec's case is but an example. The news archives contain evidence of abuses to minority citizens in many European countries since the 2000s to this day.\nCeaseless awareness Lobbying, whether we like it or not, Activism is one of the methods needed to confront this plight. So, talk about it. Make sure that other potential targets of it know that it is not fair, that they should not have to put up with it, and that they might be able to confront it in one way or another. A ceaseless awareness, fostered by a relentless activism, will also help those who exert discrimination themselves, as arguably, they are often unaware of their own act.\nThe internet The creation of awareness does not have to fully depend on close relationships. Email and social media allow safe activity where anonymity is necessary.\nConclusion The university and the academia are formed by members of society. Logically, therefore, care must taken to ward off discriminatory tendencies that exist in society.\nIf you have suffered discrimination, or you are a potential target for it, please ensure that you are aware of this plague. Regardless of the rank that a given type of discrimination occupies in the social agenda, no discrimination should be tolerated. In addition to being unethical, discrimination breaches human and fundamental rights, national laws and institutional rules.\nIf you are not a target but an ally against discrimination, please continue to confront it where you witness it, and to facilitate a widespread awareness.\nReferences Abbink, K., \u0026amp; Harris, D.

In the milliseconds during which a word is processed, the linguistic system is activated first. Reading the word entity, for instance, may activate words such as being, thing and object (https://smallworldofwords.org/en/project/explore; De Deyne et al., 2019). Thereupon, the embodied system is activated, incorporating sensorimotor, emotional and social dimensions (Borghi et al., 2019). For instance, entity activates visual, auditory and head-specific meanings (https://embodiedcognitionlab.shinyapps.io/sensorimotor_norms; Lynott et al., 2020). Research has also suggested that the linguistic system is more important for relatively abstract words—e.g., attempt—, whereas the embodied system is more important for more concrete words—e.g., building (Bolognesi \u0026amp; Steen, 2018). The role of individual differences has also been investigated (Dils \u0026amp; Boroditsky, 2010), although to a lesser extent. An individual’s linguistic experience (e.g., larger vocabulary) facilitates word processing and task-relevant attention (Pexman \u0026amp; Yap, 2018; Yap et al., 2017), while greater sensorimotor experience enables more detailed meaning activation within specific conceptual areas (e.g., space: Vukovic \u0026amp; Williams, 2015). The variation across individuals and items, within both the linguistic and embodied systems, is seldom considered simultaneously. We are undertaking this in two studies. The first study (Bernabeu et al., 2021) will merge existing datasets (Lynott et al., 2020; Pexman et al., 2017; Pexman \u0026amp; Yap, 2018; Wingfield \u0026amp; Connell, 2019). The second study will collect novel data to investigate questions such as the unique roles of vocabulary size, sensorimotor experience and attentional control. To determine the sample size for the latter study, two pilot studies with larger-than-average samples were conducted, using the aforementioned datasets and that of Hutchison et al. (2013). Simulation-based, prospective power curves were performed. These pilots revealed important roles for linguistic and embodied information, vocabulary size, and attentional control, as well as statistical power considerations.\n References Bernabeu, P., Lynott, D., \u0026amp; Connell, L.

In the milliseconds during which a word is processed, the linguistic system is activated first. Reading the word entity, for instance, may activate words such as being, thing and object (https://smallworldofwords.org/en/project/explore; De Deyne et al., 2019). Thereupon, the embodied system is activated, incorporating sensorimotor, emotional and social dimensions (Borghi et al.","tags":["cognition","conceptual processing","language comprehension","statistics","power analysis"],"title":"Linguistic and embodied systems in conceptual processing: Variation across individuals and items","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":["open science"],"content":" Video below the slides  Slideshare Video embedded from: https://nuigalway.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/OSW2021A+OSCG+Open+Scholarship+Prize+-+The+Final!/1_d7ekd3d3/121659351#t=56:08\n ","date":1620950400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1620950400,"objectID":"5a81f4095dc1bfc32348bed96eafb45f","permalink":"https://pablobernabeu.github.io/talk/towards-reproducibility-and-maximally-open-data/","publishdate":"2021-05-16T13:01:48+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/towards-reproducibility-and-maximally-open-data/","section":"talk","summary":" Video below the slides  Slideshare Video embedded from: https://nuigalway.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/OSW2021A+OSCG+Open+Scholarship+Prize+-+The+Final!/1_d7ekd3d3/121659351#t=56:08\n ","tags":["open science","open scholarship","open data","reproducibility"],"title":"Towards reproducibility and maximally-open data","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":["research methods","psycholinguistics"],"content":"Liu et al. (2018) present a study that implements the conceptual modality switch (CMS) paradigm, which has been used to investigate the modality-specific nature of conceptual representations (Pecher et al., 2003). Liu et al.\u0026lsquo;s experiment uses event-related potentials (ERPs; similarly, see Bernabeu et al., 2017; Collins et al., 2011; Hald et al., 2011, 2013). In the design of the switch conditions, the experiment implements a corpus analysis to distinguish between purely-embodied modality switches and switches that are more liable to linguistic bootstrapping (also see Bernabeu et al., 2017; Louwerse \u0026amp; Connell, 2011). The procedure for stimulus selection was novel as well as novel; thus, it could prove useful in future studies, too. In addition, the application of bayesian statistics is an interesting and promising novelty in the present research area.\nIn reviewing the literature, Liu (2018) and Liu et al. (2018) contend that previous studies may be strongly biased due to methodological decisions in the analysis of ERPs. These decisions particularly regard the latency\u0026mdash;i.e., time windows\u0026mdash;and the topographic regions of interest\u0026mdash;i.e., subsets of electrodes. Thus, Liu et al. identify a \u0026lsquo;highly inconsistent\u0026rsquo; (p. 6) landscape in the ERP components that have been ascribed to the CMS effect in previous studies. Similarly, Liu (p. 47) writes:\n Several studies have looked for the ERP manifestations of modality switching costs (Bernabeu, Willems, \u0026amp; Louwerse, 2017; Collins, Pecher, Zeelenberg, \u0026amp; Coulson, 2011; Hald, Hocking, Vernon, Marshall, \u0026amp; Garnham, 2013; Hald, Marshall, Janssen, \u0026amp; Garnham, 2011). However, what they found was not a clear picture. Not only was a significant effect found in the time window for the N400 component, but also a so-called early N400-like effect around 300ms (Bernabeu et al., 2017; Hald et al., 2011), the N1-P2 complex around 200ms (Bernabeu et al., 2017; Hald et al., 2013, 2011), as well as the late positivity component (LPC) after 600ms (Bernabeu et al., 2017; Collins et al., 2011; Hald et al., 2011).\n Drastic conclusions Liu et al. (2018) conclude that a confirmatory research approach is not warranted, and adopt a semi-exploratory approach, creating time windows of 50 ms each, rather than windows linked to known ERP components (Swaab et al., 2012), and using bayesian statistics. Such a drastic conclusion appears to stem from the assumption that, if the CMS were robust enough, it would present in the same guise across studies. Such an assumption, however, may merit further examination, considering the multiplicity of known and unknown variables that may differ across experiments (Barsalou, 2019). This variability influences the replication praxis, as it were. Indeed, Liu et al. themselves allude to one such variable (p. 7).\n These previous studies did not only examine the effect of modality switching but also other linguistic factors such as negated sentences, which could easily distort observed waveforms (Luck, 2005).\n Liu et al.\u0026lsquo;s (2018) conclusions about the \u0026lsquo;inconsistent\u0026rsquo; results do not seem to duly weigh the differences across studies. None of the existing studies is a direct replication of another. The example quoted from Liu et al. above, regarding the presence of negated sentences, is one of the less important differences because one of the corresponding studies implemented the negation as a controlled, experimental condition, contrasting with affirmative sentences (Hald et al., 2013). Yet, other differences exist in virtually every aspect, from the types of modality switch used to the time-locking of ERPs. For instance, the studies vary in the implementation of the modality switches. Whereas Hald et al. (2011) distinguish between a switch and a non-switch condition, Bernabeu et al. (2017) analysed each type of switch separately\u0026mdash;i.e., auditory-to-visual, haptic-to-visual, visual-to-visual. Another difference across the studies is the onset point for ERPs. For instance, Bernabeu et al. time-locked ERPs to the point at which the modality switch is actually elicited in the CMS paradigm\u0026mdash;namely, the first word in target trials. In contrast, the other studies time-locked ERPs to the second word. In addition, these studies vary in their timelines\u0026mdash;i.e., presentation of words and inter-stimulus intervals\u0026mdash;, as well as in the words that were used as stimuli, in the preprocessing of ERPs, in the statistical analysis, and even in the language of testing in one case (all studies using English except Bernabeu et al., 2017, which used Dutch). Moreover, the studies differ in the sample size, ranging from ten finally-analysed participants (Hald et al, 2011) to 46 finally-analysed participants (Bernabeu et al., 2017). Last, the studies differ in the number of items per modality switch condition, ranging from 17 (in one of Liu et al.\u0026lsquo;s, 2018 conditions) to 40 per condition (Hald et al., 2011, 2013). Undoubtedly, seeing larger sample sizes and more stimulus items used in ERP studies is something to promote and celebrate. Last, it may be noted that Liu et al.\u0026lsquo;s stance on the inconsistency of previous results starkly contrasts with their use of a single study\u0026mdash;Hald et al. (2011)\u0026mdash;, with N = 10, as the motivation for their sample size (Albers \u0026amp; Lakens, 2018).\nClarifications Liu et al. (2018) apply bayesian statistics reportedly to help reduce the bias that may exist in the present literature. However, the reviews by Liu (2018) and Liu et al. appear to gloss over some important aspects regarding previous studies. For instance, Liu writes (p. 53):\n The inflation of the probability of Type I error leads to an over-confidence in the interpretation of the results. For example, in the studies on modality switching costs, different time windows were chosen to test the early effect of modality switching costs. While Bernabeu et al. (2017), Hald et al. (2011) and Hald et al. (2013) examined the segment of ERP waveform between 190ms and 300ms or 160ms and 215ms based on visual inspection and found significant effects, Collins et al. (2011) chose a prescribed time window between 100ms and 200ms before the analysis and did not find the effect.\n Liu also refers to the issue of multiple tests related to the multiple time windows and electrodes we find in ERP studies (p. 59):\n It is typical for ERP studies to conduct multiple comparisons (e.g., running the same ANOVA repeatedly on different subsets of data like different time windows and different groups of electrodes). This would massively increase Type I error if no post hoc correction is conducted. However, if Bonferroni or other correction is conducted, it will render the study over-conservative, thus increasing the chance of Type II error. In the present thesis, 90 electrodes will be analysed individually, with 20 time slices in each trial. That results in 1800 NHSTs for each critical variable. A correction of multiple comparison will require a critical level of 2.78 x 10ˆ-5 for each test for a family-wise critical level of .05 (and an uncorrected test will almost definitely lead to false positive results). This stringent criterion could conceivably render it meaningless any p-values we can obtain from a statistical package.\n Arguably, the scenario presented by Liu (2018), in which a researcher could conduct a purely data-driven analysis of ERP data, is extreme. The field of psycholinguistics, in general, does not have a tradition of purely data-driven analysis. Instead, it blends a humanistic background with a scientific methodology. As a result, the hypotheses and methods tend to be largely driven by the available literature. For instance, Bernabeu et al. (2017, quoted below from p. 1632) based their time windows and regions of interest on the most relevant of the preceding studies (also see Bernabeu, 2017).\n Electrodes were divided into an anterior and a posterior area (also done in Hald et al., 2011). Albeit a superficial division, we found it sufficient for the research question. Time windows were selected as in Hald et al., except for the last window, which was extended up to 750 ms post word onset, instead of 700 ms, because the characteristic component of that latency tends to extend until then, as we confirmed by visual inspection of these results.\n The literature-based approach follows the advice from Luck and Gaspelin (2017, p. 149), who wrote: \u0026lsquo;a researcher who wants to avoid significant but bogus effects would be advised to focus on testing a priori predictions without using the observed data to guide the selection of time windows or electrode sites\u0026rsquo; (also see Armstrong, 2014; for a more conservative stance, see Luck \u0026amp; Gaspelin, 2017). In addition, notice that the extension of the last window by 50 ms was informed by Swaab et al. (2012), who report results by which the P600 component (the main component occurring after the N400 in word reading) extended up to 800 ms.\nNext, Liu et al. (2018, pp. 6\u0026ndash;7) write:\n However, the findings of these components have been highly inconsistent. The N400 effect alone was found in the posterior region in some cases (Bernabeu et al., 2017; Hald et al., 2013), while in anterior region in others (Collins et al., 2011, Hald et al. (2011)).\n Yet, Bernabeu et al. (2017, p. 1632) had written:\n In certain parts over the time course, the effect appeared in both anterior and posterior areas\n Liu et al. (2018) continue (p. 7):\n In some cases, it was found in the typical window around 400ms (Collins et al., 2011), while in others an earlier window from 270ms to 370ms (Bernabeu et al., 2017; Hald et al., 2011).\n However, Bernabeu et al. (2017, p. 1632) had written:\n The ERP results revealed a CMS effect from Time Window 1 on, larger after 350 ms.\n Regarding the time-locking of ERPs, Liu (2018, p. 43) writes:\n Because the properties were usually salient for the concepts, the switching costs might have already been incurred when participants were processing the concept word. Bernabeu et al. (2017), in their recent replication of previous ERP studies, reversed the order of concept and property and did not find an immediate effect from the property onset. In future studies, it is recommended to adopt the reverse order, control the concept words so that they do not automatically activate the properties before the words are shown, or analyse epochs after both the concept and property words.\n The above excerpt seems to reveal a misunderstanding of Bernabeu et al.\u0026lsquo;s (2017) method and results (we may assume that, by \u0026lsquo;immediate\u0026rsquo;, Liu (2018) is referring to the 200 ms point or afterwards, since that is about as immediate as it gets; see Amsel et al., 2014; Swaab et al., 2012; Van Dam et al., 2014). Bernabeu et al.\u0026lsquo;s abstract mentioned (p. 1629):\n Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) were time-locked to the onset of the first word (property) in the target trials so as to measure the effect online and to avoid a within-trial confound. A switch effect was found, characterized by more negative ERP amplitudes for modality switches than no-switches. It proved significant in four typical time windows from 160 to 750 milliseconds post word onset, with greater strength in posterior brain regions, and after 350 milliseconds.\n Indeed, time-locking ERPs to the beginning of the trial was one of the principal features of Bernabeu et al.\u0026lsquo;s (2017) experiment. Complementing that, the property words were placed in the first trial because they are more perceptually loaded than concepts (Lynott \u0026amp; Connell, 2013), thus better suiting the main basis of the CMS paradigm. We know that the semantic processing of a word often commences within the first 200 ms (Amsel et al., 2014; Van Dam et al., 2014). Considering the importance of the time course in the grounding of conceptual representations (Hauk, 2016), it seems important to measure the CMS from the moment that it is elicited\u0026mdash;namely, in all experiments, from the first word of the target trial (Bernabeu, 2017; Bernabeu et al., 2017), rather than letting several hundreds of milliseconds elapse. Nonetheless, from a methodological perspective, it would be interesting to compare the two approaches in a dedicated study. This would precisely reveal the speed at which modality-specific meaning becomes activated during conceptual processing.\nOutstanding issues: Random effects and correction for multiple tests A methodological issue affecting the statistical analysis of all the studies hereby considered (Bernabeu et al., 2017; Collins et al., 2011; Hald et al., 2011, 2013; Liu et al., 2018) is the absence of some applicable random effects. Some of the studies did not apply any random effects (Collins et al., 2011; Hald et al., 2011, 2013). Even in psycholinguistics, use of linear mixed-effects models is still increasing (Meteyard \u0026amp; Davies, 2020; Yarkoni, 2020). Yet, in those studies that did apply random effects, the corresponding structure was not as exhaustive as it should have been, as they lacked random slopes. In Bernabeu et al. (2017), a model selection approach was applied (Matuschek et al., 2017), whereby each random effect was tested and only kept in the model if it significantly improved the fit. In Liu et al. (2018), random slopes were deemed unfeasible due to computational constraints (for background, see Brauer \u0026amp; Curtin, 2017). Applying a complete random effects structure is important for a robust statistical analysis (Barr et al., 2013; Yarkoni, 2020).\nAnother issue is that of multiple tests. Where a small number of levels is used (e.g., time windows, topographic regions of interest) and these are informed by the literature, the advice has often been ambiguous as to whether a correction should be applied (e.g., Armstrong, 2014; for a more conservative stance, see Luck \u0026amp; Gaspelin, 2017). Indeed, no correction was applied in any of the four studies that used frequentist statistics (Bernabeu et al., 2017; Collins et al., 2011; Hald et al., 2011, 2013).\nReanalysis of Bernabeu et al. (2017) The results of Bernabeu et al. (2017) were reanalysed after publication using a more complete random effects structure that incorporated by-participant random slopes for the modality-switch factor\u0026mdash;i.e., (condition | participant). The results were also corrected for multiple tests using the Holm-Bonferroni correction (Holm, 1979). For this purpose, the lowest p-value in the four time windows was multiplied by 4, the next p-value by 3, the next by 2, and the highest p-value was left as it unmodified. In this stepwise correction, if a nonsignificant p-value was reached, all the subsequent p-values became nonsignificant (see analysis script). The results differed from the original, slopes-free models (available script and results) in that the main effect of the modality switch factor became nonsignificant in the second time window (160\u0026ndash;216 ms) and in the fourth one (500\u0026ndash;750 ms), while remaining significant in the third time window (350\u0026ndash;550 ms). Incidentally, note that main effects may not be directly interpretable as the same same variables are present interactions (Kam \u0026amp; Franzese, 2007). Yet, the interactions of modality switch with participant group (quick/slow) and scalp location (anterior/posterior) retained the same significance.\nOpen questions Liu (2018) and Liu et al. (2018) raise interesting and important questions. Firstly, future research may be conducted to investigate what determines the variability of ERP results\u0026mdash;in terms of ERP components, time windows and topographic regions of interest. This research could include a comparison with other measurements, such as response times, to test whether ERPs are less reliable\u0026mdash;i.e., more variable across studies\u0026mdash;than response times. Similarly, future research may investigate whether the ERP literature is more biased than literature employing other measures, such as response times. In addition, future research could investigate whether moving to exploratory, bayesian research designs is a necessary or sufficient condition to reduce bias in research and improve the precision of experimental measurements. Current alternatives to such an approach include direct (or conceptual) replications designed to achieve a higher power than previous studies (e.g., Chen et al., 2019). Arguably, policies determining funding decisions would need to change if we are to fully acknowledge the importance of direct replication (Howe \u0026amp; Perfors, 2018; Kunert, 2016; Simons, 2014; Zwaan et al., 2018). Last, future research may investigate whether \u0026lsquo;clear picture\u0026rsquo; results are realistic, desirable or necessary, and whether unclear-picture results should be eschewed; or whether, on the contrary, clear-picture results may largely be the product of publication bias\u0026mdash;that is, the pressure to hide or misreport those aspects of a study that could challenge its acceptance by peer-reviewers or any other academics.\nReferences Albers, C., \u0026amp; Lakens, D.

This variation is modelled in terms of random intercepts (e.g., overall variation per participant) as well as random slopes for the fixed effects (e.g., treatment effect per participant). These measures help reduce false positives and false negatives (Barr et al., 2013), and the resulting models tend to be robust to violations of assumptions (Schielzeth et al., 2020). The use of LMEMs has grown over the past decade, under various implementation forms (Meteyard \u0026amp; Davies, 2020). In this talk, I will look over the rationale for LMEMs, and demonstrate how to fit them in R (Brauer \u0026amp; Curtin, 2018; Luke, 2017). Challenges will also be covered. For instance, when using the widely-accepted ‘maximal’ approach, based on fitting all possible random effects for each fixed effect, models sometimes fail to find a solution, or ‘convergence’. Advice for the problem of nonconvergence will be demonstrated, based on the progressive lightening of the random effects structure (Singman \u0026amp; Kellen, 2017; for an alternative approach, especially with small samples, see Matuschek et al., 2017). At the end, on a different note, I will present a web application that facilitates data simulation for research and teaching (Bernabeu \u0026amp; Lynott, 2020).\n References Barr, D.

A false positive occurs when a result that does not exist in reality is observed in an analysis due to a methodological error (be it experimental, statistical, or otherwise). Conversely, a false negative occurs when a genuine result is not observed in an analysis, due to the same kind of error. The concept of fluke is defined by its opposite: a truthful, accurate result.\nThe label ‘fluke’ is ubiquitous where statistics is applied, from medicine to psychology and from sociology to politics.\nWhen I won in 2018, many dismissed our victory as a “fluke.”\nOur win was treated as an aberration, or bc my opponent “didn’t try.”\nSo from the start, tonight’s race was important to me.\nTonight we are proving that the people’s movement in NY isn’t an accident. It‘s a mandate. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) June 24, 2020   \nWhat’s in the label ‘fluke’—or what could there be? AOC’s tweet points at two main types of reactions to her results in the previous elections. The first type is dismissal, on the grounds of a fluke or a weak opposition. The other reaction is plain ‘aberration’. A few weeks earlier, Mark Leibovich had also delved into this issue in The New York Times (May 4, 2020, https://nyti.ms/2YsJ9fb):\n She believed misconceptions had taken hold about her: that she was angry and strident. That she was naïve. “That I just don’t know how this town works,” she said. “That I’m stupid. Or I’m lucky. That was a big thing the Democrats were saying. That I was a fluke. Which is basically just 10 different ways of saying she’s not supposed to be here.”\n The seemingly objective term ‘fluke’, with its statistical underpinning, seems to be susceptible to biased uses. We may then have to ask: Have other electoral results, comparable to AOC’s, been equally studied for signs of a fluke? Why is a certain result perceived as a fluke in the first place? From perceptual to cognitive and historical biases, people’s judgements are susceptible to visual mistakes (Zamboni, Ledgeway, McGraw, \u0026amp; Schluppeck, 2016), confirmation bias (Rajsic, Taylor, \u0026amp; Pratt, 2018) and biased records (Hug, 2003).\nIn summary, the label ‘fluke’ may in principle be skewed by:\n the eye of the beholder\n the mind of the perceiver\n the availability or lack of data\n \n Trust and distrust Problems associated with the reliance on trust and distrust have become patent even in fields that are relatively regulated against arbitrary decisions, such as higher education and academia (Barber, Hayes, Johnson, Márquez-Magaña, \u0026amp; 10,234 signatories, 2020; Milkman, Akinola, \u0026amp; Chugh, 2012, 2015).\n\n References Barber, P.

It allows the creation of varied data sets with specified structures, such as between-group and within-participant variables, that can be categorical or continuous. These parameters can be set throughout the various tabs (sections) from the top menu. In the last tab, the data set can be downloaded. The benefits of this application include time-saving and flexibility in the control of parameters.\nGuidelines General guidelines include the following:\n In the names of variables, it’s recommended only to use alphanumeric characters and underscore signs. The latter can be used to separate characters or words (e.g., variable_name). Different names should be used for each variable.\n In the levels of categorical variables, alphanumeric, special characters and spaces are allowed.\n In numeric fields (e.g., ‘Mean’, ‘Standard deviation’, ‘Relative probability [0, 1]’), only numbers and decimal points are allowed.\n As the data set increases, so does the processing time.\n  More specific guidelines are available in each section.\n 🌐 The web application can be launched here or here.

On the internet, we can find innumerable data sets from sources such as scientific journals and repositories (e.g., OSF), local and national governments (e.g., London, UK [1, 2]), non-governmental organisations (e.g., data.world), etc. Researchers inside and outside academia nowadays share a lot of their data under attribution licences (e.g., Creative Commons, the UK Open Government Licence, etc.). This allows any external analysts to access these raw data, create (additional) visualisations and analyses, and share these. In society, making data more accessible can demonstrably benefit citizens (despite limitations).\n   Activities Activities comprise free workshops and datathons.\nWorkshops R is a programming language greatly equipped for the creation of reproducible documents and dashboards. Four workshops are offered that cover a suite of interrelated tools—R, R Markdown, data dashboards and Binder environments—, all underlain by reproducible workflows and open-source software.\nEach workshop includes taught and practical sections. The practice provides a chance for participants to experience and address common issues with the code. The level of taught sections is largely tailored to participants; similarly, practice sections are individually adaptable by means of easier and tougher tasks. The duration is also flexible, and some of the workshops can be combined into the same session.\nThe RStudio interface is used in all workshops. Multi-levelled, real code examples are used. Throughout the workshops, and especially in the practice sections, individual questions will be encouraged.\nWorkshop 1: Introduction to R This workshop can serve as an introduction to R or a revision. It demonstrates what can be done in R, and provides resources for individual training. Since the duration is limited, online courses are also recommended (see examples and fee waivers for full content).\n Data structures Packages: general-purpose examples (e.g., tidyverse) and more specific ones (e.g., for statistics or geography) Loading and writing data, in native and foreign formats Wide format (also dubbed ‘untidy’) versus tidy format (also dubbed ‘long’ or ‘narrow’). For most processes in R, data needs to be in a tidy format.   Image from Postma and Goedhart (2019; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000202.g001).  Combining data sets Data summaries Plots with ggplot2::ggplot() Interactive plots with plotly::ggplotly() Statistics Linear mixed-effects models (see also a review of practices) How functions work Debugging. Code errors are known as bugs. They can tiresome, but also interesting sometimes! 😅 Some tips for the first many years of experience include: reading and investigating error messages, in both source and console windows; controlling letter case and typos; closing parentheses and inverted commas; ensuring to have the necessary packages installed and loaded; following the format required by each function. To debug, break up code into subcomponents and test each of those to find out the source of the error. Once we act on that, the best outcome is seeing the code work, but sometimes different errors overlap, in which case we may see one error disappearing before another one appears. Debugging soon leads to proficient information seeking. The search process often begins on an internet search engine and extends to user communities, package documentation, tutorials, blogs… (see video explanation). Advanced debugging tools are also available. Vast availability of free resources on the internet, from Coursera and other MOOC sites, RStudio, University of Glasgow, Carpentries, etc. Community: StackOverflow, RStudio Community, Github issues (e.g., for R packages), etc. Using and contributing back. RStudio Cloud: a personal RStudio environment on the internet   Workshop 2: R Markdown documents Set your input and output in stone using R Markdown. The analysis reports may be enriched with website features (HTML/CSS) and published as HTML, PDF or Word documents. Moreover, with R packages such as bookdown, bookdownplus, blogdown and flexdashboard, documents can be formatted as websites, digital papers and books and data dashboards. Other useful packages include rmarkdown, knitr, DT, kableExtra and ggplot2. Further background: presentation by Michael Frank, slides by Ed Berry.\nAs well as facilitating the reproducibility of analyses and results to third parties, R Markdown is helpful during the creation of a report. In particular, it reduces the chances of errors and the number of repetitive tasks. For instance, any part of the data can be inputted in the text directly from the source, rather than manually copying it (e.g., `r mean(dat[dat$location=='Havana', 'measure'])` (expand). Thus, if and when the analysis needs to be changed or updated, the report can be automatically updated at the click of a button. In another area, the captions for figures and tables can be automatised using cross-reference labels (e.g., Table \\@ref(tab:mtcars)). This secures the match between the text and the captions of figures and tables, and it automatically updates the numbering whenever and wherever a new figure or table is introduced.\n Image from bookdownplus package (https://bookdownplus.netlify.com/portfolio/).  Workshop 3: Introduction to data dashboards Data dashboards are web applications used to visualise data in detail through tables and plots. They assist in explaining and accounting for our data processing and analysis. They don’t require any coding from the end user. While most dashboards and web applications present existing data, a few of them serve the purpose of creating or simulating new data (see example).\n These all-reproducible dashboards are published as websites, and thus, they can include hyperlinks and downloadable files. Some of the R packages used are knitr, DT, kableExtra, reactable, ggplot2, plotly, rmarkdown, flexdashboard and shiny. The aim of this workshop is to practise creating different forms of dashboards—Flexdashboard and Shiny—the latter of which offers greater features, and to practise also with the hosting platforms fitting each type—such as personal websites, RPubs, Binder, Shinyapps and custom servers.\nA great thing about dashboards is that they may be made very simple, but they can also be taken to the next level using some HTML, CSS or Javascript code (on top of the back-end code present in the R packages used), which is addressed in the next workshop.\n Workshop 4: Binder environments and improving data dashboards Binder Binder is a tool to facilitate public access to software environments—for instance, by publishing an RStudio environment on the internet. Binder can also host Shiny apps. It is generously free for users. After looking at the nuts and bolts of a deployment, participants will be able to deploy their own Binder environments and check the result by the end of the workshop. For this purpose, it’s recommended to have data and R code ready, ideally in a GitHub repository.\n Improving data dashboards We will practise how to improve the functionality of dashboards using some HTML, CSS and Javascript code, which is the basis of websites.\n\u0026lt;!-- Javascript function to enable a hovering tooltip --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; $(document).ready(function(){ $(\u0026#39;[data-toggle=\u0026quot;tooltip1\u0026quot;]\u0026#39;).tooltip(); }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt;   Trade-offs among dashboards Next, we will practise with three dashboard types—Flexdashboard, Shiny and Flexdashboard-Shiny—and with the suitable hosting platforms. Firstly, the strength of Flexdashboard (example) is its basis on R Markdown, yielding an unmatched user interface (front-end). Secondly, the strength of Shiny (example) is the input reactivity (back-end) it offers, allowing users to download sections of data they select, in various formats. Last, Flexdashboard-Shiny (example) combines the best of both worlds.\n★  Flexdashboard  ★ ★ ★  Shiny  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★  Flexdashboard-Shiny  ★ ★ ★ Flexdashboard types are rendered as an HTML document—simple websites—, and can therefore be easily published on personal sites or RPubs. This is convenient because no special hosting is required. In contrast, Shiny and Flexdashboard-Shiny types offer greater features, but require Shiny servers. Fortunately, the shinyapps.io server is available for free, up to some usage limit. This server can host any of the three dashboards mentioned here. Another good option is presented by Binder environments, which can host the Shiny-type dashboards with no (explicit) limit. Yet, the Flexdashboard-Shiny type cannot be hosted in this server (as of January 2020, at least). Consequently, greater functionality may come at a cost for dashboards that have any considerable traffic, whereas dashboards with low traffic may do well on shinyapps.io. Knowing these trade-offs can help navigate usage limits, save on web hosting fees, and increase the availability of our dashboards online, as we can offer fall-back versions on different platforms, as in the example below:\n … preferred-dashboard (in case of downtime, please visit this alternative)\n Transforming dashboards into the different versions can be as easy as enabling or disabling some features, especially input reactivity. For instance, if we want to downgrade a Flexdashboard-Shiny to a Flexdashboard, to publish it outside of a Shiny server (see example), we must delete runtime:shiny from the header, and disable reactive features, as below.\n ```r # Number of words selected on sidebar # reactive(cat(paste0(\u0026#39;Words selected below: \u0026#39;, nrow(selected_props())))) ```  Free accounts and tips Hosting sites have specific terms of use. For instance, shinyapps.io has a free starter license with limited use. Free apps can handle a large but limited amount of data, and up to five apps may be created. Beyond this, RStudio offers a wide range of subscriptions starting at $9/month.\nMemory and traffic limits of the free shinyapps.io account can sometimes present problems when heavy data data sets are used, or there are many visits to the app. The memory overload issue is often flagged as Shiny cannot use on-disk bookmarking, whereas excessive traffic may see the app not loading. Fortunately, usage limits need not always require a paid subscription or a custom server, thanks to the following workarounds:\n develop app locally as far as possible, and only deploy to shinyapps.io only at the last stage; prune data set, leaving only the necessary data; if necessary, unlink data by splitting it into different sets, reducing computational demands; if necessary, use various apps (five are allowed in each free shinyapps.io account); if necessary, link from the app to a PDF with visualisations requiring heavy, interlinked data. High-resolution plots can be rendered into a PDF document in a snap, using code such as below.   pdf(\u0026#39;List of plots per page\u0026#39;, width = 13, height = 5) print(plot1) print(plot2) # ... print(plot150) dev.off()  Conveniently, all text in a PDF—even in plots—is indexed, so it can be searched [ Ctrl+f / Cmd+f / 🔍 ] (see example). Furthermore, you may also merge the rendered PDF with any other documents.\n  Prerequisites and suggestions for participation in each workshop Necessary: laptop or computer with R and RStudio installed, or access to RStudio Cloud; familiarity with the content of the preceding workshops through the web links herein.\nSuggested: having your own data and R code ready (on a Github repository if participating in Workshop 4); participation in some of the preceding workshops.\n  Datathons: creating reproducible documents and dashboards In these coding meetups, participants collaborate to create reproducible documents or dashboards using the data and software they prefer (see examples). Since the work can be split across different people and sections, some nice products may be achieved within a session. Any programming languages may be used.\n Data used: academic or non-academic data of your own or from open-access sources such as OSF, scientific journals, governments, international institutions, NGOs, etc.\n Inspired by the great Reprohacks, content suggestions are encouraged. That is, if you’d like to have a reproducible document or dashboard created for a certain, open-access data set, please let us know, and some participants may take it on. Suggestions may be posted as issues or emailed to p.bernabeu@lancaster.ac.uk.   Purposes\n collaborating to visualise data in novel ways using reproducible documents or interactive dashboards. For this purpose, participants sometimes draw on additional data to look at a bigger picture;\n reflecting on the process by reviewing the techniques applied and challenges encountered.\n  Output: A key aspect of datathons is the creation of output. Documents and dashboards are (co-)authored by the participants who work on them, who can then publish them on their websites, or on RPubs, Binder, Shinyapps or custom servers. Time constraints notwithstanding, a lot of this output may be very enticing for further development by the same participants, or even by other people if the code is shared online. Just like with data, an attribution licence can be attached to the code.\n  Prerequisites and suggestions for participation in datathons Necessary: basic knowledge of reproducible documents or dashboards.\nSuggested: familiarity with the development of reproducible documents or dashboards; an idea about the data you’d like to work with and the kind of document or dashboard you want to create.\n   Contact Please submit any queries or requests by posting an issue or emailing p.bernabeu@lancaster.ac.uk.\n ","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"d4c6f6ca4eb0c2665fdbb559c58d2620","permalink":"https://pablobernabeu.github.io/2020/data-is-present-workshops-and-datathons/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2020/data-is-present-workshops-and-datathons/","section":"post","summary":"This project offers free activities to learn and practise reproducible data presentation.

Let's look at their reason-to-be for the purposes of research, and how they are defined and processed. Most of this content is based on my master's thesis, which I could fortunately conduct at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics (see thesis or conference paper).\nElectroencephalography The brain produces electrical activity all the time, which can be measured via electrodes on the scalp—a method known as electroencephalography (EEG). These pulses are produced for every one of our states and actions, in a voltage at a micro (µ) scale, typically between 10 µV (0.000010) and 100 µV (0.000100; Aurlien et al., 2004). The overlapping pulses happen at extremely high frequencies; indeed, the signal can be measured once per millisecond. The high frequency of this signal is very interesting for the study of some cognitive processes in particular, for which the time course is (or may be) critical. One such example is conceptual processing, namely, the process of understanding the meaning of words.\nResearch has revealed the relation between certain EEG patterns and cognitive states and functions. Brain activity includes dozens of types, but broadly, it can be divided into neural oscillations and event-related potentials. Specific oscillations (also known as brain waves) are associated with states such as wakefulness, sleep, arousal, relaxation, etc. (Roohi-Azizi, Azimi, Heysieattalab, \u0026amp; Aamidfar, 2017). Event-related potentials instead represent more finite events, such as the presentation of as a stimulus. In cognitive neuroscience, both oscillations and ERPs are studied, whereas in cognitive psychology, ERPs are much more common than oscillations. Let's dive into ERPs below.\nEvent-related potentials In the lab, ERPs are elicited using controlled designs. In each trial, a series of stimuli are presented. At a fixed point therein, an EEG measurement begins and spans for a certain period. In turn, in the analysis, this measurement period is divided into time windows, which often correspond to specific ERP components (e.g., N400 window).\nIn psycholinguistics, for instance, a typical scenario is the presentation of words, and ERPs are systematically time-locked to the same position in consecutive trials, often the onset of a word. By this means, the experimental manipulation is collected, and the non-experimental variation—\u0026lsquo;noise\u0026rsquo;—is largely cancelled out by the aggregation of multiple trials that share the experimental manipulation.\nThe chief reason to employ the ERP method is the measurement of cognitive processes online, that is, precisely as they unfold. This is fitting in the context of language comprehension, where some important processes last for less than a second.\nTime course of word processing Processing a word takes around 800 milliseconds (ms). Within that time, earlier processes (compared to later ones) have been ascribed greater relevance to the core process of understanding a word (Mahon \u0026amp; Caramazza, 2008). This assumes that broader processes start only after more immediate ones have started (but see Lebois, Wilson‐Mendenhall \u0026amp; Barsalou, 2014). The most immediate process is the recognition of a string of letters, which seems to start within 90 ms post word onset in early auditory cortex and the Visual Word Form Area (Willems, Frank, Nijhoff, Hagoort, \u0026amp; van den Bosch, 2016). Then ensue further, fundamental stages known as lexical and semantic processes. Lexical processing is the identification of a string of letters as a known word, and it happens within around 160 ms post word onset. Next, at around 200 ms, we may see the beginning of semantic processing, which denotes a further step in the cognitive analysis of the word that is akin to meaning (Hauk, 2016). These processes may overlap, as indeed suggested by the sensitivity of the N400 ERP (see also next section) to both lexical and semantic tasks (Kutas \u0026amp; Federmeier, 2011). Both processes also likely extend further in the processing timeline (Hauk, 2016). In spite of this overlap, however, lexical and semantic processing have often been linked to different cognitive phenomena. For instance, tasks promoting semantic processing (e.g., semantic decision, whereby participants describe words as concrete or abstract) have been found to engage sensorimotor simulation of the word's meaning (known as embodiment) more strongly than lexical tasks do (Connell \u0026amp; Lynott, 2013; Pexman, Muraki, Sidhu, Siakaluk, \u0026amp; Yap, 2019; Sato, Mengarelli, Riggio, Gallese, \u0026amp; Buccino, 2008).\nOnce the lexical and semantic stages have emerged, post-lexical, post-semantic processes follow (Mahon \u0026amp; Caramazza, 2008). These are mental imagery and episodic memory processes—both with an approximate emergence around 270 ms after word onset. The gradual progression from the identification of a word up to accessing its broadest meaning is an important anchoring point in the current research on the alleged embodiment of meaning comprehension, even if we might hope to count on more definitive threshold points (Hauk, 2016).\nWord processing data are mainly based on written word processing, but spoken words are processed quite similarly, if slightly faster (Leonard, Baud, Sjerps, \u0026amp; Chang, 2016; Pulvermüller, Shtyrov, \u0026amp; Ilmoniemi, 2005; Shtyrov, Hauk, \u0026amp; Pulvermüller, 2004).\nThe bigger take-home messages would be: (1) the processing of meaning might only start at around 160 ms post word onset, and (2) processes outside of meaning comprehension might only start at around 270 ms. These working references must be taken with some caution because particular semantic effects have been found at different stages (e.g., the conceptual modality switch, as in Hald, Marshall, Janssen, \u0026amp; Garnham, 2011; Collins, Pecher, Zeelenberg, \u0026amp; Coulson, 2011). Indeed, in an influential critique of blooming findings on embodiment, Mahon and Caramazza (2008) argued that even early effects might possibly be explained in terms of non-embodied processing. They contended that working memory processes that were ancillary rather than semantic could be quickly engaged with the function of ‘colouring’ a concept, not building it up. To further complicate the matter, we do not have absolute certainty on the later section of the time course. Thus, as Hauk (2016) reviews, the different stages likely overlap at certain points, with different degrees of relevance. For instance, lexical processing may continue even once semantic processing has started, but would naturally become less relevant. Indeed, the relation among these processes is likely more of a continuum than a set of clear-cut modules. In a nutshell, the time course is important with some experimental effects in word processing, and, to that extent, we depend on our knowledge of the basic time course of word processing.\nThe conceptual modality switch paradigm and its time course In demonstrating the relevance of embodied cognition, a sizeable series of studies have shown that reading about different conceptual modalities (e.g., auditory ‘loud bell’ followed by visual ‘pink background’) incurs processing costs (Pecher, Zeelenberg, \u0026amp; Barsalou, 2003). Importantly, this manipulation does not concern the presentation mode of the stimulus, maintained constant, but the intrinsic semantic modality of the stimulus concepts. The conceptual modality switch effect has often been replicated (Pecher, Zeelenberg, \u0026amp; Barsalou, 2004; Solomon \u0026amp; Barsalou, 2004; Marques, 2006; Vermeulen, Niedenthal, \u0026amp; Luminet, 2007; van Dantzig, Pecher, Zeelenberg, \u0026amp; Barsalou, 2008; Lynott \u0026amp; Connell, 2009; Ambrosi, Kalenine, Blaye, \u0026amp; Bonthoux, 2011; Collins et al., 2011; Hald et al., 2011; Hald et al., 2013; Scerrati et al., 2015).\nBernabeu, Willems and Louwerse (2017) addressed a caveat with the time course of the conceptual modality switch paradigm. In previous experiments, trials presented a concept word followed by a property word. ERPs were time-locked to the latter property word. This design may have left uncontrolled a switch produced already at the concept. Indeed, the property word was already supposed to be in the particular modality of the trial. That pitfall could have had two consequences: loss of power and loss of certainty on the time course of the effect. Thus, Bernabeu et al. created a design in which ERPs were time-locked to the first word in target trials (see some early input from researchers online). The purpose of this relocation was not to completely annul the possibility of post-core sensory processes, but to increase the time accuracy by measuring the modality switch from the point at which it is elicited.\nImplementing this design had an ancillary effect on the measurement of response times. A psycholinguistic experiment like this one requires controlling fundamental variables such as word frequency and length, by matching the means of these variables across experimental conditions. This must be controlled in the target words at least. As it is often the case, this control was only possible in the target words—the first one in target trials—, but it was not possible in the second word, which is the crucial one for response times. Response times could still be measured, but comparisons across conditions were not fully warranted. In sum, this was an ERP design.\nERP components When the ERP signal is plotted, it displays multiple wave shapes, or waveforms, each with a peak flanked by falling tails. Each of these waves often corresponds to an ERP component, which is what cognitive scientists are often interested in.\nMultiple components are known, each having been found to consistently peak around specific points in time during a cognitive process. The peak is one of several features characterising each component. A sketch list is shown below (van Hell \u0026amp; Kroll, 2013).\n  Polarity: The component either peaks in the positive or the negative pole of the signal. This polarity is relative to the baseline point that is created in the preprocessing stage (see below);\n  Latency: the time course of the component, encompassing an onset, a peak and an overall duration. Time windows are normally set to match relevant components (e.g., the N400 window, etc.);\n  Amplitude: the voltage reached at a given time (e.g., the peak) or for a certain period (e.g., a time window);\n  Scalp distribution, or topography: the areas on the scalp (the scalp being a reasonable proxy for the brain) in which the component appears;\n  Functional role: the cognitive functions that have been consistently associated with the component.\n  Examples of components in language processing include the N400, consistently linked to semantic processing, that is, seeking the meaning of words or sentences. The N400 is characterised by a large, negative amplitude peaking at around 400 ms post word onset, primarily found in central and posterior sites. N400 effects, which are comparisons of the N400 component in different experimental conditions, have consistently appeared under violations of semantic expectations, i.e., related to meaning and events (Kutas \u0026amp; Federmeier, 2011; Swaab, Ledoux, Camblin, \u0026amp; Boudewyn, 2012). Another well-known component in language is the P600, linked to syntactic processing, which allows the comprehension of sentences (Swaab et al., 2012). Other examples of components include lateralized readiness potentials, signalling motor preparation (Mordkoff \u0026amp; Gianaros, 2000), and the P3b component, which appears in the context of responses (van Vliet et al., 2014). Both of the latter components are relevant to researchers across domains, who often need to ward off contamination from these components in their experiments. In Bernabeu et al.\u0026lsquo;s experiment, for instance, part of the reason why ERPs were time-locked to the first word in target trials was to prevent contamination from these components.\nERP data sets are large, being the product of the number of electrodes times the number of time points, times the number of experimental conditions, times the number of participants. In recent studies, the number of trials often adds to that product, whereas in previous experiments, the trials tended to be aggregated in each condition.\nEEG montage The EEG montage is an important factor. The options are broadly characterised by three parameters of the electrodes (also called channels):\nBrainwaves exposed for an open day.\n  Number: Traditionally, montages with 32, 64 or 128 electrodes have been used. The larger the number, the higher the spatial resolution.\n  Wet / dry: In some montages, the electrical conductance on the electrodes\u0026rsquo; contact point must be increased using some fluid solutions, such as a specific gel (often commercialised by the companies that also make EEG apparatuses). Conversely, other electrodes function in a dry way. Ensuring the proper conductance on wet electrodes has traditionally been very time-consuming for experimenters, often taking over half an hour of wiggling a blunt syringe distributing the saline solution around the tip. Traditionally, wet electrodes produced more reliable data than dry ones, but the times they are a'changing (di Flumeri, 2019).\n  Active / passive: In some wet montages, the conductance-prompting job is much facilitated by the existence of a pilot light on top of each electrode, which signals the conductance level throughout the setup on the participant's head.\n  An EEG/ERP experiment is time-consuming. The preparation (especially conductance-prompting with wet montages) and post-experiment procedures (especially washing the EEG cap) often take four or five times as long as the experiment proper. These procedures are especially long for higher-density, wet, passive montages.\nPreprocessing ERPs ERPs are not the first signal collected in experiments. They are obtained after considerable, systematic preprocessing of the EEG signal.\n\nFor the Bernabeu et al. study, I used Brain Vision software, and followed the tutorials from the well-known ERP Boot Camp of Steve Luck and Emily Kappenman. I applied the following pipeline separately for each participant:\n  labeling channels (64 electrodes);\n  creating channel groups (anterior and posterior);\n  re-referencing the signal offline to the right mastoid (RM), having referenced online to the left mastoid (Ref);\n  \n separating my three experimental conditions;\n  ocular correction for blinks and significant, vertical or horizontal movements of the eyes (seminal method by Gratton, Coles, \u0026amp; Donchin, 1983, which is the default in Brain Vision);\n  baseline correction, which is a standardisation based on a certain period immediately before the onset of the target manipulation;\n  further correction of artifacts such as motor action potentials (or lateralised readiness potentials) resulting from even the subtlest muscle activity.\n  This pipeline is reflected in the scripts exported from Brain Vision.\n \u0026lt;Nodes\u0026gt; \u0026lt;string\u0026gt;1/Raw Data\u0026lt;/string\u0026gt; \u0026lt;string\u0026gt;1/Raw Data/labels\u0026lt;/string\u0026gt; \u0026lt;string\u0026gt;1/Raw Data/labels/positions\u0026lt;/string\u0026gt; \u0026lt;string\u0026gt;1/Raw Data/labels/positions/rerefRM\u0026lt;/string\u0026gt; \u0026lt;string\u0026gt;1/Raw Data/labels/positions/rerefRM/TotalMatch\u0026lt;/string\u0026gt; \u0026lt;string\u0026gt;1/Raw Data/labels/positions/rerefRM/TotalMatch/OcularCorrection\u0026lt;/string\u0026gt; \u0026lt;string\u0026gt;1/Raw Data/labels/positions/rerefRM/TotalMatch/OcularCorrection/baselinecorr\u0026lt;/string\u0026gt; \u0026lt;string\u0026gt;1/Raw Data/labels/positions/rerefRM/TotalMatch/OcularCorrection/baselinecorr/baselinecorr_artif\u0026lt;/string\u0026gt; \u0026lt;string\u0026gt;1/Raw Data/labels/positions/rerefRM/TotalMatch/OcularCorrection/baselinecorr/baselinecorr_artif/minave_TotalMatch\u0026lt;/string\u0026gt; \u0026lt;string\u0026gt;1/Raw Data/labels/positions/rerefRM/EmbodiedMismatch\u0026lt;/string\u0026gt; \u0026lt;string\u0026gt;1/Raw Data/labels/positions/rerefRM/EmbodiedMismatch/OcularCorrection\u0026lt;/string\u0026gt; \u0026lt;string\u0026gt;1/Raw Data/labels/positions/rerefRM/EmbodiedMismatch/OcularCorrection/baselinecorr\u0026lt;/string\u0026gt; \u0026lt;string\u0026gt;1/Raw Data/labels/positions/rerefRM/EmbodiedMismatch/OcularCorrection/baselinecorr/baselinecorr_artif\u0026lt;/string\u0026gt; \u0026lt;string\u0026gt;1/Raw Data/labels/positions/rerefRM/EmbodiedMismatch/OcularCorrection/baselinecorr/baselinecorr_artif/minave_EmbodiedMismatch\u0026lt;/string\u0026gt; \u0026lt;string\u0026gt;1/Raw Data/labels/positions/rerefRM/TotalMismatch\u0026lt;/string\u0026gt; \u0026lt;string\u0026gt;1/Raw Data/labels/positions/rerefRM/TotalMismatch/OcularCorrection\u0026lt;/string\u0026gt; \u0026lt;string\u0026gt;1/Raw Data/labels/positions/rerefRM/TotalMismatch/OcularCorrection/baselinecorr\u0026lt;/string\u0026gt; \u0026lt;string\u0026gt;1/Raw Data/labels/positions/rerefRM/TotalMismatch/OcularCorrection/baselinecorr/baselinecorr_artif\u0026lt;/string\u0026gt; \u0026lt;string\u0026gt;1/Raw Data/labels/positions/rerefRM/TotalMismatch/OcularCorrection/baselinecorr/baselinecorr_artif/minave_TotalMismatch\u0026lt;/string\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Nodes  Word reading ERPs can look somewhat like this after the preprocessing (plots made in R).\n\nTo visualise these waveforms throughout the different sections of the data, a dashboard is available.\nStatistical analysis With the myriad repeated measures involved in EEG, linear mixed-effects models are a good option, allowing the registration of electrodes and time points in the error term per participant (and trial, too, if these are not aggregated).

Learning how to use ERPs is demanding but even more rewarding. It certainly does not make for fast science, but allows the measurement of experimental effects online, that is, as they unfold.\nYou can learn about and overcome multiple challenges. One of the issues I faced once regarded some channels (electrodes) that appeared to be missing from the data. I posted a question on ResearchGate, and emailed Brain Products, the maker of Brain Vision Recorder, which I was using.\n Hi everyone,\nIf you could please give me a hand with this error, I would be very grateful. I have EEG from a psychological experiment, recorded with BrainVision Recorder, and being analyzed with BrainVision Analyzer 2. Most of the recordings are perfectly fine, but a few present a big error. Out of 64 original electrodes, only two appear. These are the right mastoid (RM) and the left eye sensor (LEOG). Both are bipolar electrodes. RM is to be re-referenced to the online reference electrode, while LEOG is to be re-referenced to the right eye electrode.\nI just can't fathom the error because all electrodes worked fine during the recording. Also, the data sets with the error are quite as heavy in terms of bytes as those without the error. Further, why should the RM and LEOG channels remain perfectly well as they do?\nThis issue might seem like a simple zoom I've bypassed, or similar\u0026hellip; But unfortunately the channels are just not there. I've confirmed it as I tried to copy the pipeline from the good data sets onto the faulty ones, where I got the error \u0026lsquo;No channels enabled.\u0026rsquo; In case you had access to the BVA analysis software, please find the raw files for one of the faulty data sets here.\n Thanks to invaluable help from a ResearchGate contributor and the Brain Products team, I could put the pieces back together.\n Update: Problem solved.\nAs Nikolay said, the error originated in Recorder (I had used the workspace from the previous experimenter), and the problem was solved by setting the label and position of each channel.\nI tried editing the .vhdr file in raw (it seemed nice and quick to directly assign the channel names as labels) but i didn't quite find the way. Therefore, with a tip from the Brain Products team, I went about it within the program.\nFirst, I used the transform function \u0026lsquo;Edit channels\u0026rsquo; to rename all labels and set each within their coordinates. I did that for just one subject (it doesn't take as long as it sounds). Afterwards, I created a \u0026lsquo;History template\u0026rsquo; out of that process, and copied it to all other nodes. At any rate, never getting out of the comfort workspace again\u0026hellip; :D\n References Ambrosi, S., Kalenine, S., Blaye, A., \u0026amp; Bonthoux, F. (2011).

For instance, the way movement is expressed in a person’s native language may influence how they perceive movement. Motion event encoding (MEE) is usually framed as a typological dichotomy. Path-in-verb languages tend to encode path information within the verb (e.g., ‘leave’), whereas manner-in-verb languages encode manner (e.g., ‘jump’). The results of MEE-based linguistic relativity experiments range from no effect to effects on verbal and nonverbal cognition. Seeking a more definitive conclusion, we propose linguistic and experimental enhancements. First, we examine state-of-the-art typology, suggesting how a recent MEE classification across twenty languages ( Verkerk, 2014 ) may enable more powerful analyses. Second, we review procedural challenges such as the influence of verbal thought and second-guessing in experiments. To tackle these challenges, we propose distinguishing verbal and nonverbal subgroups, and having enough filler items. Finally we exemplify this in an experimental design.","tags":["linguistic relativity","psycholinguistics","linguistics","nonverbal"],"title":"More refined typology and design in linguistic relativity: The case of motion event encoding","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bernabeu, P."],"categories":["linguistic materials","conceptual replication"],"content":"Reference Bernabeu, P.

The current study presents modality exclusivity norms for 336 properties and 411 concepts in Dutch. Forty-two respondents rated the auditory, haptic, and visual strength of these words. Mean scores were then computed, yielding acceptable reliability values. Measures of modality exclusivity and perceptual strength were also computed. Furthermore, the data includes psycholinguistic variables from other corpora, covering length (e.g., number of phonemes), frequency (e.g., contextual diversity), and distinctiveness (e.g., number of orthographic neighbours), along with concreteness and age of acquisition. To test these norms, Lynott and Connell???s (2009, 2013) analyses were replicated. First, unimodal, bimodal, and tri-modal words were found. Vision was the most prevalent modality. Vision and touch were relatively related, leaving a more independent auditory modality. Properties were more strongly perceptual than concepts. Last, sound symbolism was investigated using regression, which revealed that auditory strength predicted lexical properties of the words better than the other modalities did, or else with a different direction.

It comes in very useful whenever doubts arise about the true origin of three or more variables. There are two main methods for performing a PCA: naive or less naive. In the naive method, you first check some conditions in your data which will determine the essentials of the analysis. In the less-naive method, you set those yourself based on whatever prior information or purposes you had. The latter method is appropriate when you already have enough information about the intercorrelations, or when you are required to select a specific number of components. I will tackle the naive method, mainly by following the guidelines in Field, Miles, and Field (2012), with updated code where necessary. A manual by Charles M. Friel (Sam Houston State University) was also useful.\nThe ‘naive’ approach is characterized by a first stage that checks whether the PCA should actually be performed with your current variables, or if some should be removed. The variables that are accepted are taken to a second stage which identifies the number of principal components that seem to underlie your set of variables.\n\nSTAGE 1. Determine whether PCA is appropriate at all, considering the variables  Variables should be inter-correlated enough but not too much. Field et al. (2012) provide some thresholds, suggesting that no variable should have many correlations below .30, or any correlation at all above .90. Thus, in the example here, variable Q06 should probably be excluded from the PCA.\n Bartlett’s test, on the nature of the intercorrelations, should be significant. Significance suggests that the variables are not an ‘identity matrix’ in which correlations are a sampling error.\n KMO (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin), a measure of sampling adequacy based on common variance (so similar purpose as Bartlett’s). As Field et al. review, ‘values between .5 and .7 are mediocre, values between .7 and .8 are good, values between .8 and .9 are great and values above .9 are superb’ (p. 761). There’s a general score as well as one per variable. The general one will often be good, whereas the individual scores may more likely fail. Any variable with a score below .5 should probably be removed, and the test should be run again.\n Determinant: A formula about multicollinearity. The result should preferably fall below .00001.

Identify number of components (aka factors) In this stage, principal components (formally called ‘factors’ at this stage) are identified among the set of variables.\n The identification is done through a basic, ‘unrotated’ PCA. The number of components set a priori must equal the number of variables that are being tested.  # Start off with unrotated PCA pc1 = psych::principal(dataset, nfactors = length(dataset), rotate=\u0026quot;none\u0026quot;) pc1  Below is an example result:\n## Principal Components Analysis ## Call: psych::principal(r = eng_prop, nfactors = 3, rotate = \u0026quot;none\u0026quot;) ## Standardized loadings (pattern matrix) based upon correlation matrix ## PC1 PC2 PC3 h2 u2 com ## Aud_eng -0.89 0.13 0.44 1 -2.2e-16 1.5 ## Hap_eng 0.64 0.75 0.15 1 1.1e-16 2.0 ## Vis_eng 0.81 -0.46 0.36 1 -4.4e-16 2.0 ## ## PC1 PC2 PC3 ## SS loadings 1.87 0.79 0.34 ## Proportion Var 0.62 0.26 0.11 ## Cumulative Var 0.62 0.89 1.00 ## Proportion Explained 0.62 0.26 0.11 ## Cumulative Proportion 0.62 0.89 1.00 ## ## Mean item complexity = 1.9 ## Test of the hypothesis that 3 components are sufficient. ## ## The root mean square of the residuals (RMSR) is 0 ## with the empirical chi square 0 with prob \u0026lt; NA ## ## Fit based upon off diagonal values = 1  Among the columns, there are first the correlations between variables and components, followed by a column (h2) with the ‘communalities’. If less factors than variables had been selected, communality values would be below 1. Then there is the uniqueness column (u2): uniqueness is equal to 1 minus the communality. Next is ‘com’, which reflects the complexity with which a variable relates to the principal components. Those components are precisely found below. The first row contains the sums of squared loadings, or eigenvalues, namely, the total variance explained by each linear component. This value corresponds to the number of units explained out of all possible factors (which were three in the above example). The rows below all cut from the same cloth. Proportion var = variance explained over a total of 1. This is the result of dividing the eigenvalue by the number of components. Multiply by 100 and you get the percentage of total variance explained, which becomes useful. In the example, 99% of the variance has been explained. Aside from the meddling maths, we should actually expect 100% there because the number of factors equaled the number of variables. Cumulative var: variance added consecutively up to the last component. Proportion explained: variance explained over what has actually been explained (only when variables = factors is this the same as Proportion var). Cumulative proportion: the actually explained variance added consecutively up to the last component (Field et al., 2012).\nAccording to Field et al. (2012), two criteria will determine the number of components to select for the next stage:\n Kaiser’s criterion: components with SS loadings \u0026gt; 1. In our example, only PC1.  A more lenient alternative is Joliffe’s criterion, SS loadings \u0026gt; .7.\n Scree plot: the number of points after point of inflexion. For this plot, call:  plot(pc1$values, type = \u0026#39;b\u0026#39;) Imagine a straight line from the first point on the right. Once this line bends considerably, count the points after the bend and up to the last point on the left. The number of points is the number of components to select. The example here is probably the most complicated (two components were finally chosen), but normally it’s not difficult.\nBased on both criteria, go ahead and select the definitive number of components.\n\n STAGE 3. Run definitive PCA Run a very similar command as you did before, but now with a more advanced method. The first PCA, a heuristic one, worked essentially on the inter-correlations. The definitive PCA, in contrast, will implement a prior shuffling known as ‘rotation’, to ensure that the result is robust enough (just like cards are shuffled). Explained variance is captured better this way. The go-to rotation method is the orthogonal, or ‘varimax’ (though others may be considered too).\n# Now with varimax rotation, Kaiser-normalized by default: pc2 = psych::principal(dataset, nfactors=2, rotate = \u0026quot;varimax\u0026quot;, scores = TRUE) pc2 pc2$loadings # Healthcheck pc2$residual pc2$fit pc2$communality  According to Field et al. (2012), we would want:\n Less than half of residuals with absolute values \u0026gt; 0.05 Model fit \u0026gt; .9 All communalities \u0026gt; .7  If any of this fails, consider changing the number of factors. Next, the rotated components that have been ‘extracted’ from the core of the set of variables can be added to the dataset. This would enable the use of these components as new variables that might prove powerful and useful (as in this research).\ndataset = cbind(dataset, pc2$scores) summary(dataset$RC1, dataset$RC2) \n STAGE 4. Determine ascription of each variable to components Check the main summary by just calling pc2, and see how each variable correlates with the rotated components. This is essential because it reveals how variables load on each component, or in other words, to which component a variable belongs. For instance, the table shown here belongs to a study about the meaning of words (Bernabeu, 2018). These results suggest that the visual and haptic modalities of words are quite related, whereas the auditory modality is relatively unique. When the analysis works out well, a cut-off point of r = .8 may be applied for considering a variable as part of a component.\n\n STAGE 5. Enjoy the plot The plot is perhaps the coolest part about PCA. It really makes an awesome illustration of the power of data analysis.\nggplot(eng_props, aes(RC1, RC2, label = as.character(main_eng))) + stat_density2d (color = \u0026quot;gray87\u0026quot;) + geom_text(size = ifelse(eng_props$word_eng %in% w_set, 12, 7), fontface = ifelse(eng_props$word_eng %in% w_set, \u0026#39;bold\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;plain\u0026#39;)) + geom_point(data=eng_props[eng_props$word_eng %in% w_set,], pch=21, fill=NA, size=14, stroke=2, alpha=.6) + labs(subtitle=\u0026#39;(Data from Lynott \u0026amp; Connell, 2009)\u0026#39;, x = \u0026quot;Varimax-rotated Principal Component 1\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Varimax-rotated Principal Component 2\u0026quot;) + theme_bw() + theme( plot.background = element_blank(), panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), panel.border = element_blank(), axis.line = element_line(color = \u0026#39;black\u0026#39;), axis.title.x = element_text(colour = \u0026#39;black\u0026#39;, size = 23, margin=margin(15,15,15,15)), axis.title.y = element_text(colour = \u0026#39;black\u0026#39;, size = 23, margin=margin(15,15,15,15)), axis.text.x = element_text(size=16), axis.text.y = element_text(size=16), plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 32, face = \u0026quot;bold\u0026quot;, margin=margin(15,15,15,15)), plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 20, margin=margin(2,15,15,15)) ) + geom_label_repel(data = eng_props[eng_props$word_eng %in% w_set,], aes(label = word_eng), size = 8, alpha = 0.77, color = \u0026#39;black\u0026#39;, box.padding = 1.5 )  Below is an example combining PCA plots with code similar to the above. These plots illustrate something further with regard to the relationships among modalities. In property words, the different modalities spread out more clearly than they do in concept words. This makes sense because in language, properties define concepts (Bernabeu, 2018).\nAn example of these analyses is available in available in this RStudio environment, in the norms.R script.\n\n References Bernabeu, P.

It comes in very useful whenever doubts arise about the true origin of three or more variables. There are two main methods for performing a PCA: naive or less naive. In the naive method, you first check some conditions in your data which will determine the essentials of the analysis. In the less-naive method, you set those yourself based on whatever prior information or purposes you had. The 'naive' approach is characterized by a first stage that checks whether the PCA should actually be performed with your current variables, or if some should be removed. The variables that are accepted are taken to a second stage which identifies the number of principal components that seem to underlie your set of variables.","tags":["s","principal component analysis","statistics","dimensionality reduction","R"],"title":"Naive principal component analysis in R","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":["psycholinguistics"],"content":"  Throughout the 1990s, two opposing theories were used to explain how people understand texts, later bridged by the Landscape Model of reading (van den Broek, Young, Tzeng, \u0026amp; Linderholm, 1999). A review is offered below, including a schematic representation of the Landscape Model.\nMemory-based view The memory-based view presented reading as an autonomous, unconscious, effortless process. Readers were purported to achieve an understanding of a text as a whole by combining the concepts, and implications readily afforded, in the text with their own background knowledge (Myers \u0026amp; O’Brien, 1998; O’Brien \u0026amp; Myers, 1999). This memory-based view did not include a conscious (re)activation of meaning. Arguably, this absence raises the question of how readers could recover the meaning if ever distracted while reading.\n Constructionist view The constructionist view contended that readers make strategic, time-consuming efforts to access prior text and background knowledge (Graesser, Singer, \u0026amp; Trabasso, 1994; Singer, Graesser, \u0026amp; Trabasso, 1994). A possible challenge for this view is in leisure reading. If reading is effortful, how could it be explained when people become absorbed in leisure reading for hours, and enjoy it? How could this activity become as automatic and fast as it often does?\n Landscape Model The memory-based and the constructionist views were bridged in a proposal called the Landscape Model (van den Broek et al., 1999). With a step-based model, van den Broek et al. argued that strategic (re)activations are available to the reader, but need not always be used (see also Converse, 2018). Figure 1 illustrates the dynamic, often cyclical processes.\nFigure 1. Mindmap of van den Broek et al.’s Landscape Model of reading comprehension. Retrieved from https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1591215.\n The Landscape Model was applied to the context of discourse analysis by Yeari and van den Broek (2011). The authors noted that discourse analysts may find it useful to adopt a top-down, inductive approach to their task. That is, suppressing the natural, incremental route of meaning making in reading, discourse analysts may want to read through the text to gain a general idea first, before tackling a detailed analysis (see also Bell, 2011).\n References Bell, A.

It would constitute perceptual simulation only if it has a functional role in conceptual processing. We investigated this in an Event-Related Potential (ERP) experiment implementing the conceptual modality switch paradigm. In each trial, participants verified the relation between a property word and a concept word. Orthogonally, we manipulated the conceptual modality of successive trials, and tested whether switching modalities incurred any processing costs at different stages of word recognition. Unlike previous studies, we time-locked ERPs to the first word of target trials, in order to measure the modality transitions from the beginning, and also to reduce confounds within the target trial. Further, we included different types of switch\u0026mdash;one from auditory to visual modality, and one from haptic to visual\u0026mdash;, which were compared to the non-switch\u0026mdash;visual to visual. Also, one group of participants was asked to respond quickly (n = 21), and another group to respond self-paced (n = 21), whilst a few others received no constraints (n = 5). We found ERP effects in four typical time windows from 160 to 750 ms post word onset. The overall effect is characterized by a negativity for modality-switching relative to not switching, and it increases over time. Further, the effect arises with both types of switch, and influences both participant groups within anterior and posterior brain regions. The emergence of this effect in the first time window particularly suggests that sensory regions may have a functional role in conceptual processing. The increased effect later on converges with previous studies in supporting the compatibility of distributional and embodied processing. On a less conclusive note, more research may be necessary to ascertain the nature of the effect at late stages.","tags":["Brain Vision","cognition","cognitive neuroscience","conceptual modality switch","conceptual processing","conceptual replication","electrodes","event-related potentials","electroencephalography","language comprehension","linear mixed-effects models","psycholinguistics","reading"],"title":"Modality switches occur early and extend late in conceptual processing: Evidence from ERPs [Master's thesis]","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":["statistics"],"content":"  The clock strikes a certain hour, below all the Greg’s teaspoons at play.

So, hardly any of the 95% Confidence Intervals contain 0. Does this really mean…?\n ‘For example, the hypothesis of equality of population means will be rejected at the 0.05 level if and only if a 95% CI for the mean difference does not contain 0.’\n — Dallal (2002; http://www.jerrydallal.com/lhsp/pval.htm)\nOf course. The CI just has that and more. The window is showing a chilly 1999 morning. Let’s see the summary again. Wee standard deviations. By card, please.\nMmm, the air outside is worth gingering up…\n The trials!\n The assumption of independence spoils another morning.\nThis new data consisted of response times (RT) that had been collected over several trials. The single dependent variable, RT, was accompanied by other variables which could be analyzed as independent variables. These included Group, Trial Number, and a within-subjects Condition. What had to be done first off, in order to take the usual table? The trials!\nAssumption of independence of observations One must account for any redundant measures below the level of participants (the experimental trials, in this case), so that the sample size (N) used for any summary statistics match the number of participants (or the largest group, n). Why? This is a central assumption in statistics: observations must be independent. We can observe the independence assumption differently, depending on whether we’re summarizing data or performing statistical tests.\n For descriptive tables and plots (involving Standard Error/Deviation, Confidence Intervals, etc), the data ought to be aggregated to the level from which you want to generalize. That level is—in this case and very often—participants. Trials do not normally serve for statistical generalization (they’re good for experimental validity). This realization may come as a bummer if you have first seen the effect sizes in the un-aggregated data. The mirage (see red lines on the left table below) is caused by an inflated N (cf. red lines on the right-hand table). As an illustration, the tables below summarize data with an actual sample n = 23. However, the table on the right includes repeated measures that should have been aggregated, massively inflating n. The inflation of the sample size equals the product of all repeated measures that failed to be aggregated under participants.  Measures of variance such as the Standard Deviation divide by the sample size. Thus, the larger the sample (N), the smaller the Standard Deviation, Standard Error, Confidence Interval…—that is, the variation or noise.\nAggregating is a snap. For example, with the aggregate() function in R, you just have to include all of your variables except that or those of the repeated measures:\nbehdata_aggreg = aggregate(behdata$RT, list(behdata$Ptp, behdata$Group, behdata$Cond), data=behdata, FUN=mean)  In statistical tests, repeated measures below the participant level–e.g., trials–normally must be either factored in or aggregated. Barr and colleagues provide an easy, focused guide on this procedure. This is necessary because when the N in the analyses is augmented by unaccounted, redundant observations, the famous assumption of independence of observations is violated, and the results may be invalid, as Vasishth and Nicenboim (2016, p. 3) put it:   ‘if we were to do a t-test on the unaggregated data, we would violate the independence assumption and the result of the t-test would be invalid.’\n Now, usually the repetitions that concern us are the multiple trials or items in experiments, or other sub-participant measures. So what about participants–what are they never aggregated? McCarthy, Whittaker, Boyle, and Eyal (2017, p.10) note:\n ‘It has also been proposed that researchers aggregate the responses of participants within the same group and use the groups/clusters as the unit of analysis (Stevens, 2007). However, because this would result in losing sample size at the participant level, this approach is not optimal given the already small numbers of groups typically studied in group work research.’\n  Different procedure in linear mixed-effects models Aggregation is no longer necessary, where linear mixed-effects models can be used. These models allow us to account for any clusters (Participants, Trials, Items…) by signing them into the error term (Brauer \u0026amp; Curtin, 2017).\n ","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"72b40be553d5d3f800e313bb7c15010d","permalink":"https://pablobernabeu.github.io/2017/at-greg-8-am/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2017/at-greg-8-am/","section":"post","summary":"The single dependent variable, RT, was accompanied by other variables which could be analyzed as independent variables.

This possibility challenges long-established theories. It suggests a strong link between physical experience and language which is not borne out of the paradigmatic arbitrariness of words (see Lockwood, Dingemanse, \u0026amp; Hagoort, 2016). Modality-specificity also clashes with models of language that have no link to sensory and motor systems (Barsalou, 2016).\n\u0026nbsp; Conference paper  \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; Master's thesis  \u0026nbsp;  Early discussion on ResearchGate Data and code Data dashboard  In the Conceptual Modality Switch (CMS) paradigm, participants perform a property verification task, deciding whether certain property words can reasonably describe concept words. Covertly, the conceptual modality of consecutive trials is manipulated in order to produce specific switches in conceptual modality. For instance, after the trial Soundless Answer, which is primarily auditory, the following trial may match in modality—Loud Welcome—or mismatch—Fine Selection (visual).\nModality switches incur processing costs, as reflected in brain signals linked to semantic violation, and in longer response times (RTs) (Scerrati, Lugli, Nicoletti, \u0026amp; Borghi, 2016). This effect suggests that perceptual features of concepts are accessed during conceptual processing. More recently, however, the CMS effect was reanalysed using a non-perceptual alternative. Louwerse and Connell (2011) found that language statistics (the co-occurrence of words in a language) were able to approximately predict visual/haptic, olfactory/gustatory, and auditory modalities, but not the subtler differences between visual and haptic and between olfactory and gustatory, which seemed to be reserved for perceptual simulations. Moreover, faster response times (RTs) were best explained by language statistics, whereas slower RTs were best explained by perceptual simulations.\nThe time course of word processing is important. Research suggests that word processing spans one second, during which different processes—semantic and post-semantic—gradually accumulate (Hauk, 2016). The later an effect, the more reasons to question it. Yet, having an early emergence does not either make an effect lexicosemantic, as the meaning encoded could have gone through working memory before activating the actual system of interest, e.g., sensorimotor (Mahon \u0026amp; Caramazza, 2008). Research also suggests that modal systems may contribute to conceptual processing early on—within 200 ms (Vukovic, Feurra, Shpektor, Myachykov, \u0026amp; Shtyrov, 2017). Thus, measuring effects online may prove valuable.\nExperiment Bernabeu, Willems and Louwerse (2017) investigated whether CMS reflects a functionally relevant process of simulation or instead arises only after basic conceptual processing has been attained. We also examined whether different processing systems, amodal and modal, may compatibly operate.\nWe measured CMS online by time-locking Event-Related brain Potentials (ERPs) to the onset of the first word in the target trials, in order to assess how strongly CMS may be influenced by post-semantic processes. Previous research would predict an increase in the CMS effect over time because earlier processing is relatively amodal (Louwerse \u0026amp; Hutchinson, 2012).\nWe tested the compatibility of amodal and modal processing by drawing on Louwerse and Connell’s (2011) findings. In this conceptual replication, we split participants into a Quick and a Slow group based on RT. Maintaining CMS as a within-subjects factor, we predicted that the larger modality switches (e.g., auditory to visual) would be picked up equally by both groups, whereas the subtler switches (e.g., haptic to visual) would be picked up only—or more clearly—by the Slow group.\nMethod The stimuli were normed (Bernabeu, Louwerse, \u0026amp; Willems, in prep.). Three CMS conditions were created—Auditory-to-visual, Haptic-to-visual, Visual-to-visual—, each with 36 target trials. The property verification task was pretested valid (N = 19).\nResults All participants but one responded correctly to over half of the trials, with an overall accuracy of 63%.\nERPs showed a CMS effect from time window 1 on, larger after 350 ms. It appeared with both switch conditions, and was characterized by a more negative amplitude for the switch conditions compared to the no-switch condition. It was generally stronger in the posterior brain regions, and in the Slow group. The results are illustrated in the figure below, which includes 95% Confidence Intervals and time windows.\nThe analysis was done with Linear Mixed Effects models. Final models presented good fits, with R2 ranging from .748 to .862. First, the CMS effect in time window 1 was confirmed significant. Such an early emergence is unprecedented in the CMS literature, and it may have been enabled by the time-locking of ERPs to the first word in target trials. In this time window, the only process not lexicosemantic is possibly working memory (Hauk, 2016), and therefore this early emergence adds support to the possibility that CMS was directly caused by perceptual simulation.\nWhereas in time window 1, the effect was circumscribed to an interaction with Brain Area, by Time Window 2, a main effect of CMS emerged. In Windows 3 and 4, the only experimental effect was CMS.\nBonferroni-corrected, planned ANOVA contrasts into CMS conditions revealed that the no-switch condition differed significantly from the switch conditions. By contrast, the switch conditions (Haptic-to-visual and Auditory-to-visual) hardly differed from each other, underscoring the CMS effect.\nAlthough the interaction of Group and CMS was only significant in Time Windows 1 and 2, Windows 2 to 4 presented a pattern fitting our predictions (Louwerse \u0026amp; Connell, 2011). While the Slow group picked up the switches across all modalities similarly, the Quick group picked up the Auditory-to-visual switch more clearly than the Haptic-to-visual switch.\nStatistical analysis .embed-responsive{position:relative;height:100%;}.embed-responsive iframe{position:absolute;height:100%;}window.jQuery || document.write('\\x3C/script')  var mfrRender = new mfr.Render(\"mfrIframe\", \"https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/sx3nw/?direct%26mode=render%26action=download%26mode=render\"); Discussion Results broadly suggest that cognition may operate on qualitatively different systems for the same task.

These web applications can be useful for both the data analyst and the public at large. Visualisation apps run on internet browsers. This allows for three options: private viewing (useful during analysis), selective sharing (used within work groups), or internet publication. Among the available platforms, R Shiny and Tableau stand out due to being relatively accessible to new users. Apps serve a broad variety of purposes (see this gallery and this one). In science and beyond, these apps allow us to go the extra mile in sharing data. Alongside files and code shared in repositories, we can present the data in a website, in the form of plots or tables. This facilitates the public exploration of each section of the data (groups, participants, trials…) to anyone interested, and allows researchers to account for their proceeding in the analysis.\nPublishers and journals highly encourage authors to make the most of their data by facilitating its easy exploration by the readership–even though they don’t normally offer the possibility of hosting any web applications yet.\nApps can also prove valuable to those analysing the data. For instance, my app helped me to identify the extent of noise in a section of the data. Instead of running through a heavy score of code, the drop-down lists of the app let me seamlessly surf through the different sections.\nAt a certain point, I found a data section that was consistently noisier than the rest, and eventually I had to discard it from further statistical analyses. Yet, instead of removing that from the app, I maintained it with a note attached. This particular trait in the data was rather salient.\nBeyond such a salient feature in the data, a visualisation app may also help to spot subtler patterns such as third variables or individual differences.\nThere are several platforms for creating apps (e.g., Tableau, D3.js, and R Shiny). I focus on R Shiny here for three reasons: it is affordable to use, fairly accessible to new users, and well suited for science as it is based on the R language (see for instance this article).\n How to Shiny Shiny apps draw on any standard R code that you may already have. This is most commonly plots or tables, but other stuff such as images or Markdown texts are valid too. This is a nice thing to keep in mind when having to create a new app. Part of the job may already be done! The app is distributed among five different areas.\n Data file(s): These are any data files you’re using (e.g., with csv or rds extensions).  1a. server.R script The server script contains the central processes: plots, tables, etc. Code that existed independently of the app app may be brought into this script by slightly adapting it. At the top, call the shiny library and any others used (e.g., ‘ggplot2’), and also read in the data. The snippet below shows the beginning of an example server.R script.\n # server library(shiny) library(ggplot2) EEG.ParticipantAndElectrode = readRDS(\u0026#39;EEG.ParticipantAndElectrode.rds\u0026#39;) EEG.ParticipantAndBrainArea = readRDS(\u0026#39;EEG.ParticipantAndBrainArea.rds\u0026#39;) EEG.GroupAndElectrode = readRDS(\u0026#39;EEG.GroupAndElectrode.rds\u0026#39;) EEG.OLDGroupAndElectrode = readRDS(\u0026#39;EEG.OLDGroupAndElectrode.rds\u0026#39;) server = shinyServer( function(input, output) { # plot_GroupAndElectrode: output$plot_GroupAndElectrode \u0026lt;- renderPlot({ dfelectrode \u0026lt;- aggregate(microvolts ~ electrode*time*condition, EEG.GroupAndElectrode[EEG.GroupAndElectrode$RT.based_Groups==input$var.Group,], mean) df2 \u0026lt;- subset(dfelectrode, electrode == input$var.Electrodes.1) df2$condition= as.factor(df2$condition) df2$condition \u0026lt;- gsub(\u0026#39;visual2visual\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;

Deployment and logs This script contains the commands for deploying the app on- or off-line, and for checking the session logs in case of any errors.\n 3. Automatically created folder When the app is first deployed on the internet, a subfolder is automatically created with the name ‘rsconnect’. This folder contains a text file which can be used to modify the URL and the title of the webpage.\nSteps to create a Shiny app from scratch:\n1. Tutorials (link). Being open-source software, excellent directions are available through a Google search.\nThe core ideas are:\nAs mentioned above, create a ui.R script for the code containing the user interface, and create a server.R script for the code containing the main content (your plots / tables, etc).\nAt the top of both ui.R and server.R scripts, enter the command library(shiny) and also load any other libraries you’re using (e.g., ggplot2).\nTest your app by deploying it locally, before launching online. For this purpose, first save the ui and server parts independently, as in:\n ui = shinyUI( fluidPage( # ...  Then deploy locally by running:\nshinyApp(ui, server) Managing to run the app locally is a great first step before launching online (which may sometimes prove a bit trickier).\n2. User token (link). Sign up and read in your private key—just to be done once in a computer.\n3. Go for it. After locally testing and saving the two main scripts (ui.R and server.R), run deployApp() to launch the app online.\n4. Bugs and session logs. Most often they won’t be bugs actually, but fancies, as it were. For instance, some special characters have to get even more special (technically, UTF-8 encoding). For a character such as ‘μ’, Shiny prefers ‘Âμ’, or better, the Unicode expression(\"\\u03bc\").\nCling to your logs by calling the line below, which you may keep at hand in your ‘Shiny deployer.R’ script.\nshowLogs(appPath = getwd(), appFile = NULL, appName = NULL, account = NULL, entries = 50, streaming = FALSE) At best, the log output will mention any typos and unaccepted characters, pointing to specific lines in your code.\nIt may take a couple of intense days to get a first Shiny app running. Although the usual rabbit holes do exist, years of Shiny have already yielded a sizeable body of free resources online (tutorials, blogs, vlogs). Moreover, there’s also the RStudio Community, and then StackOverflow etc., where you can post any needs/despair. Post your code, log, and explanation, and you’ll be rescued out in a couple of days. Long live those contributors.\nIt’s sometimes enough to upload a bare app, but you might then think it can look better.\n5 (optional). Advance. Use tabs to combine multiple apps on one webpage, use different widgets, include a download option, etc. Tutorials like this one on Youtube can take you there, especially those that provide the code, as in the description of that video. Use those scripts as templates. For example, I made use of tabs on the top of the dashboard in order to keep the side bar from having too many widgets. The appearance of these tabs can be adjusted. More importantly, the inputs in the sidebar can be modified depending on the active tab, by means of ‘reactivity’ conditions.\n mainPanel( tags$style(HTML(\u0026#39; .tabbable \u0026gt; .nav \u0026gt; li \u0026gt; a {background-color:white; color:#3E454E} .tabbable \u0026gt; .nav \u0026gt; li \u0026gt; a:hover {background-color:#002555; color:white} .tabbable \u0026gt; .nav \u0026gt; li[class=active] \u0026gt; a {background-color:#ECF4FF; color:black} .tabbable \u0026gt; .nav \u0026gt; li[class=active] \u0026gt; a:hover {background-color:#E7F1FF; color:black} \u0026#39;)), tabsetPanel(id=\u0026#39;tabvals\u0026#39;, tabPanel(value=1, h4(strong(\u0026#39;Group \u0026amp; Electrode\u0026#39;)), br(), plotOutput(\u0026#39;plot_GroupAndElectrode\u0026#39;), h5(a(strong(\u0026#39;See plots with 95% Confidence Intervals\u0026#39;), href=\u0026#39;https://osf.io/2tpxn/\u0026#39;, target=\u0026#39;_blank\u0026#39;), style=\u0026#39;text-decoration: underline;\u0026#39;), downloadButton(\u0026#39;downloadPlot.1\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Download HD plot\u0026#39;), br(), br(), # EEG montage img(src=\u0026#39;https://preview.ibb.co/n7qiYR/EEG_montage.png\u0026#39;, height=500, width=1000)), tabPanel(value=2, h4(strong(\u0026#39;Participant \u0026amp; Area\u0026#39;)), br(), plotOutput(\u0026#39;plot_ParticipantAndLocation\u0026#39;), h5(a(strong(\u0026#39;See plots with 95% Confidence Intervals\u0026#39;), href=\u0026#39;https://osf.io/86ch9/\u0026#39;, target=\u0026#39;_blank\u0026#39;), style=\u0026#39;text-decoration: underline;\u0026#39;), downloadButton(\u0026#39;downloadPlot.2\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Download HD plot\u0026#39;), br(), br(), # EEG montage img(src=\u0026#39;https://preview.ibb.co/n7qiYR/EEG_montage.png\u0026#39;, height=500, width=1000)), tabPanel(value=3, h4(strong(\u0026#39;Participant \u0026amp; Electrode\u0026#39;)), br(), plotOutput(\u0026#39;plot_ParticipantAndElectrode\u0026#39;), br(), downloadButton(\u0026#39;downloadPlot.3\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Download HD plot\u0026#39;), br(), br(), # EEG montage img(src=\u0026#39;https://preview.ibb.co/n7qiYR/EEG_montage.png\u0026#39;, height=500, width=1000)), tabPanel(value=4, h4(strong(\u0026#39;OLD Group \u0026amp; Electrode\u0026#39;)), br(), plotOutput(\u0026#39;plot_OLDGroupAndElectrode\u0026#39;), h5(a(strong(\u0026#39;See plots with 95% Confidence Intervals\u0026#39;), href=\u0026#39;https://osf.io/dvs2z/\u0026#39;, target=\u0026#39;_blank\u0026#39;), style=\u0026#39;text-decoration: underline;\u0026#39;), downloadButton(\u0026#39;downloadPlot.4\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Download HD plot\u0026#39;), br(), br(), # EEG montage img(src=\u0026#39;https://preview.ibb.co/n7qiYR/EEG_montage.png\u0026#39;, height=500, width=1000)) ),  \nThe official Shiny gallery offers a great array of apps including their code (e.g., basic example).

For instance, we can link back to the data repository, where the code for the app can be found.\nAn example of a Shiny app is available, which may also be edited and run in this RStudio environment, inside the ‘Shiny-app’ folder.\nThe Shiny server (shinyapps.io) allows publishing dashboards built with various frameworks besides Shiny proper. Flexdashboard and Shinydashboard are two of these frameworks, which have visible advantages over basic Shiny, in terms of layout. An example with Flexdashboard is available.\n★  Flexdashboard  ★ ★ ★  Shiny  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★  Flexdashboard-Shiny  ★ ★ ★   Logistics Memory capacity can become an issue as you go on, which will be flagged in the error logs as: ‘Shiny cannot use on-disk bookmarking’. This doesn’t necessarily lead you to a paid subscription or to host the website on a custom server. Try pruning the data file, outsourcing data sections across the five available apps.\nApp providers have specific terms of use. To begin, Shiny has a free starter license with limited use, where free apps can handle a certain amount of data, and up to five apps may be created. Beyond that, RStudio offers a wide range of subscriptions starting at $9/month. For its part, Tableau in principle deals only with subscriptions from $35/month on. While they offer 1-year licenses to students and instructors for free, these don’t include web hosting, unlike Shiny’s free plan. Further comparisons of these platforms are available online. Last, I’ll just mention a third language, D3, which is powerful, and may also be used through R.\nIn the case of very heavy data or frequent public use, if you don’t want to host your Shiny app externally, you might consider rendering a PDF with your visualisations instead.\n pdf(\u0026quot;List of plots per page\u0026quot;, width=13, height=5) print(plot1) print(plot2) # ... print(plot150) dev.off()  High-resolution plots can be rendered into a PDF document in a snap. Conveniently, all text is indexed, so it can be searched (Ctrl+f / Cmd+f / 🔍) (see example).

These web applications run on internet browsers, allowing for three viewing modes, catered to both analysts and the public at large: (1) private viewing (useful during analysis), (2) selective sharing (used within work groups), and (3) internet publication. Among the available platforms, R Shiny and Tableau stand out due to being relatively accessible to new users. Apps serve a broad variety of purposes. In science and beyond, these apps allow us to go the extra mile in sharing data. Alongside files and code shared in repositories, we can present the data in a website, in the form of plots or tables. This facilitates the public exploration of each section of the data (groups, participants, trials...) to anyone interested, and allows researchers to account for their proceeding in the analysis.","tags":["s","data presentation","dashboard","reproducibility","open science","open data","R","R Shiny","Flexdashboard"],"title":"The case for data dashboards: First steps in R Shiny","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["conceptual processing","R"],"content":"\u0026nbsp; Dashboard  \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; Alternative in case of downtime  \u0026nbsp; Content\nThe data is from a psychology experiment on the comprehension of words, in which electroencephalographic (EEG) responses were measured. The data are presented in plots spanning 800 milliseconds (the duration of word processing). The aim of this Shiny app is to facilitate the exploration of the data by researchers and the public. Users can delve into the different sections of the data. In a hierarchical order, these sections are groups of participants, individual participants, brain areas, and electrodes.\nShiny apps in science\nBy creating this app, I tried to reach beyond the scope of current open science, which is often confined to files shared on data repositories. I believe that Shiny apps will become general practice in science within a few years (see blog post or slides for more information).\nTechnical details\nI made use of tabs on the top of the dashboard in order to keep the side bar from having too many widgets.

Introduction Racism has long been ingrained in human societies. Ancient Greek Aristotle already claimed that non-Greeks were slaves by nature, as they easily submitted to despotic government (Reilly, Kaufman, \u0026amp; Bodino, 2002). This study focuses on racism in the United States, which extends from the foundation of the country, when black people were generally born into slavery, and were at any rate regarded as an inferior people. US racism stands out globally for two reasons. First, the country has played a hegemonic part in the World since soon after its foundation. Second, the US is regarded as the most advanced society technology-wise, as it sets the minutes for the technology sector worldwide. In spite of these advantages, the country has long suffered the plague of widespread racism. Indeed, the abolition of slavery in the mid-nineteenth century did not grant equal citizen rights to the black population. Over time, the black population started to confront this situation. Especially the mid-nineteenth century saw large uprisings and a patent division of different societal sectors, as reflected in literary works such as Ellison’s ‘Invisible Man’ (1952). Inequality and confrontation about racism has extended to date, and the costs thereof have been large in terms of lives and otherwise (Feagin, 2004).\nWith the era of global communication, what happens in the World’s most powerful country is quickly and largely spread overseas—so too with racism matters. The last major such event related to racism happened during the first weeks of July 2016. Within five days, two cases of dubious, lethal police intervention with black citizens were followed by the killing of five policemen by a black youth. The specific course of events was as follows. On July 5th, Alton Sterling was killed by police officers in Louisiana. Next day, Philando Castile was also killed by police. In this case, the presence of Castile’s girlfriend during the tragedy likely determined the following events, because she described the event to the media, underscoring how gratuitous the killing was. During the following hours, outrage escalated within the already-wary population of the US. Yet the crisis would not stop there. During one of the various demonstrations held across the country, a dozen policemen were shot by a sniper, leaving five of them dead. The attacker was a black youth linked to black militant groups which target the Establishment on the grounds of patent racial discrimination. We will refer to this concatenation of events as the Louisiana-Minnesota-Texas (LMT) crisis.1\nIn the welter of events in Louisiana, Minnesota and Texas, some journalists warned of the return of social divisions such as those from the mid-nineteenth century. Such divisions might lead some people to an incomplete perception of the situation, and thus hinder the achievement of any solutions. However, President Obama denied such divisions as he spoke at the funeral for the policemen killed. At the same time, he addressed each of the different groups in the problem, including Establishment institutions and black protesters, advising them all to exercise greater open-mindedness towards the other aspects and bands in the problem (see statement).\nIt must be noted that this small study is primarily a way for us to practise data analysis at a course. Neither the background nor the analyses make a realistic study of racism or the LMT crisis.\n 2. Goals We wanted to look at these developments from the scope of online data. For this purpose, we scraped online discussions on these developments from a variety of media sources, and within defined time frames in the crisis. We then probed for any noticeable fluctuations in the topics throughout the course of events, and also for any differences across the different media. In this analysis, we took an exploratory approach by means of topic modeling. We wanted to check, first, whether topic modeling would be sensitive and useful at all within such a compact time scale. Were it to allow us, we would analyze how the journalistic and the social media reflected any fluctuations based on the live developments in Louisiana, Minnesota and Texas. As such, the dependent variable (DV) in this study is the overall topic under discussion, which we measured via topic modeling. So, the language we analyze are messages related to the LMT crisis. Two factors are checked as potentially affecting the DV, namely Media and Time.\nThe Media factor regarded the three different sources of information from which we retrieved content, namely: (1) the New York Times (NYT), (2) public tweets related to the NYT, and (3) public comments on the NYT’s Facebook posts.\nThe Time factor was based on the following periods. The first period, from 2 to 4 July, was selected as a baseline during which no remarkable events racism-wise happened. The second period, including 5 and 6 July, contains the days when the two black citizens were killed by policemen. The third period, from 7 to 11 July, contains the aftermath of the crisis overall.\n 3. Hypotheses We had several hypotheses for our planned analyses. For the Media factor, we hypothesized a greater objectivity and formality overall for the NYT articles compared to the other two sources.\nWe did not have any hypotheses about the Time factor, i.e., the nature of any potential topic changes. In fact, we had considerable reservations as to whether any fluctuations would present, given the fact that the latent feeling of such a crisis might stay negative, critical and fearful from the start, regardless of particular events.\nWith respect to the interaction between the two factors, we hypothesized that the NYT articles would present the lowest degree of thematic variation, due to the fact that such journal pieces require time to investigate and write up—even if they are published online. Comparatively, popular comments on Twitter and Facebook would present more emotionality and subjectivity, and likely they would also present greater influence of immediate events. Furthermore, Twitter should be yet more immediate than Facebook.\nLast, with respect to the DV, we did not actually have any hypotheses about the nature of possible topic fluctuations.\n 4. Methods Online reactions to the LMT developments were scraped from various online sources. This content was constrained to language, bearing no extensions such as pictures or videos. In order to narrow the scope of the information, all scraped sources were related to The New York Times journal. The sources were, first, the NYT online edition (nytimes.com); second, public tweets related to NYT (@nytimes); and, third, public comments posted on the NYT page (@nytimes). Crucially, these sources are different in nature. Whereas the articles in the journal’s online edition broadly follow the standard article form of mainstream journals, Facebook comments on the page are aligned with the Facebook standards, that is, comparatively informal and outspoken. In accord, tweets referring to @nytimes follow the Twitter conventions, characterized by the 140-character restriction, and the relative immediacy of their information (Oh \u0026amp; Syn, 2015; Wang, He \u0026amp; Zhao, 2014; Josephson \u0026amp; Miller, 2015).\nThe method to scrape content related to the LMT crisis was through keywords. For the three media, the following keywords were entered, such that articles containing any of those words would be returned: ‘black’ OR ‘racism’ OR ‘police’ OR ‘dallas’ OR ‘alton’ OR ‘sterling’ OR ‘philando’ OR ‘castile.’ Further particulars are provided in turn.\nNew York Times. This scraping pipeline started from the official API site for NYT (https://developer.nytimes.com). Metadata was downloaded for 2,000 articles adjusting to the abovementioned keywords. This returned articles dating back to the start of the year. After preprocessing, 29 articles were returned for period 1; 53 for period 2; and 275 for period 3.\nTwitter. This scraping was performed through Geoff Jentry’s R package ‘twitteR’ (https://github.com/geoffjentry/twitteR). Here tweets were selected based on the same keywords, in addition to ‘@nytimes’. Due to the ten-day maximum range of Twitter’s API, no time range was entered. Retweets were removed. With the naked eye we realized that the tweets contained considerable information on Saudi events, we entered the word ‘saudi’ as a negative keyword. After preprocessing, 157 articles were returned for period 1; 489 for period 2; and 5025 for period 3.\nFacebook. The ‘RFacebook’ R package, by Pablo Barbera (https://github.com/pablobarbera/Rfacebook), was used for this scraping. The Facebook API currently allows for the download of all or any posts from one page, with no time restrictions (broader-search functions seem to have been deprecated). We downloaded any comments on the pages’ posts which adjusted to our keywords. After preprocessing, 195 articles were returned for period 1; 1107 for period 2; and 8724 for period 3.\nPreprocessing was performed equally for all sources—as standard in topic modeling, by removing non-relevant (‘stop-words’) and non-linguistic elements. Removed items included the names of the media, as well as numbers, punctuation, links, and technical signs such as @.\n 5. Results Our hypothesis about the Media factor was only partially confirmed. First, sentiment analysis showed that NYT posts were very tempered, with an average sentiment score near 0. In contrast, Twitter presented a rather negative sentiment (Thelwall, Buckley, \u0026amp; Paltoglou, 2011; Saif, He, Fernandez, \u0026amp; Alani, 2016). Yet, to our surprise, Facebook came out with a neutrality close to that of NYT articles, even if there was greater variance among the scores of the Facebook posts. These overall tendencies are illustrated in the plot below. Caution must recommended, however, when considering this sentiment analysis, as this technique is arguably fuzzy generally, and especially so with data under such a tight time frame. This is the case because sentiment analysis, as other big data techniques, capitalizes on the size of data. What it lacks on the precision aspect, compared to null-significance hypothesis testing, for instance, it compensates with the size of the samples, in which the noise is suppressed by thousands of cases. In this case, however, the sampling within only nine days of unusual circumstances calls for circumspection.\nNext, topic modeling was conducted on each source separately. The parameters for topic discovery were entered based on several attempts with different numbers of topics (K) and internal-coherence thresholds (alpha). Finally, topics were selected alike for every source, K = 3, alpha = .2. Below, the first ten words for each topic in each source are shown (note that columns are aligned rightward).\nNew York Times articles ## Foreign policy Shooting Elections ## 1 said police new ## 2 percent said one ## 3 vote officers people ## 4 year black can ## 5 brexit dallas like ## 6 will officer york ## 7 since shooting trump ## 8 european two july ## 9 british shot even ## 10 britain says just  Facebook comments ## Police People Black lives matter ## 1 police people black ## 2 gun will lives ## 3 cops can matter ## 4 people like white ## 5 officers get people ## 6 dont one racist ## 7 just just blm ## 8 man need police ## 9 get dont blacks ## 10 officer police obama  Tweets ## Racism Dallas shooting Philando shooting ## 1 black police police ## 2 police dallas blacks ## 3 white officers new ## 4 lives killed shooting ## 5 people protest philando ## 6 racism shooting force ## 7 amp shootings castile ## 8 matter alton use ## 9 stop sterling says ## 10 cops baton violence To start, it may stand out that different topics appear across sources, all the while some are indeed shared. This is perfectly normal for topic modeling on different sources, even when the same topic is being studied. Indeed, it is very relevant for us to remark on the inclusion of foreign affairs and election matters within the NYT articles, but not within people’s tweets and Facebook comments. This makes sense for several reasons. To start, the space a journalist counts on in a NYT article is considerable, compared to tweets, and also compared to ruling conventions of Facebook posts (users may write further, but the average simply will not). Second, the breadth of relation in NYT articles likely responds to the expectations from renown journalists to enrich the news with a broader contextualization. Furthermore, this extension of topics might correspond to the tacit but doubtless alignment of journals to concrete political agendas. While people commenting on Twitter or Facebook are plausibly characterized by just the same virtues and vices, their online reactions could be driven by more emotion and immediacy of focus than those of mass media journalists.\nFor greater visualization, we also provide some captions from the interactive LDAvis tool below. Please click on the figure titles to enjoy the full visualization.\n↑ LDAvis visualization of NYT articles (click to explore in detail)\n \n↑ LDAvis visualization of Facebook comments (click to explore in detail)\n \n↑ LDAvis visualization of tweets (click to explore in detail)\n \nIn order to specifically compare different content sources, we plotted the major language from two sources on the same plot, with an axis spanning from one source to the other, as shown below. The size of the words indicates the frequency of use, and the colour is essentially parallel with the axis, with specific different colours for different corpora, and darker hues for greater association.\n↑ Facebook comments and NYT articles\n ↑ Facebook comments and tweets\n ↑ Tweets and NYT articles\n \nWe went on to analyze the overlap in topics across journals, in order to quantitatively check whether some topics were indeed shared across sources, even if in different positions (for instance, topic 1 in some source and topic 3 in some other). We did this by means of cosine similarity scores. These scores represent the degree of similarity of two sources on a continuous scale from 0 to 1, where 1 would mean identical. The plots illustrate these comparisons in turn.\n↑ Similarity between Facebook comments and NYT articles ↑ Similarity between Facebook comments and tweets ↑ Similarity between tweets and NYT articles Last, the interaction of Time and Media was analyzed. As expected, we found differences in the way topics fluctuated over time in the different sources, albeit in unexpected ways. NYT and tweets articles presented great variation, suggesting day-bound sensitivity to the developments. This was to be expected from Twitter, as it is famous for its immediacy. However, the immediacy of NYT articles was rather surprising, as they might have lagged behind due to the necessary investigation and editing for such kind of journalistic pieces. Unlike traditional paper-based NYT articles, this immediacy is now enabled by the publication online. Another unexpected finding was the relative stillness of Facebook posts over time. Since they are published at the minute, and nowadays mostly from mobile, we had thought they would present greater immediacy than NYT articles. We could hypothesize on this, but this would be best analyzed in further research. The plot below illustrates this interaction.\n↑ Topic fluctuations over time for the three content sources\n   6. Discussion In this small-scale study, we analyzed the impact of a racism-related crisis in the American society online. This crisis started with the killing of two black citizens by policemen under dubious circumstances, which was followed by massive media attention and street demonstrations, and then continued to the fatal shooting of five policemen by a black militant (the crisis continued yet further after our analyses). The impact of this crisis was large, with a state funeral being organized for the killed policemen, and a presidential address warning of the direction of social tensions, and the need for greater empathy from all social sections involved.\nWe scraped the divided the social reaction to these events from three online sources, namely, the NYT online edition, public comments on the NYT Facebook page, and finally NYT-related tweets. The method was based on keywords highly relevant to this crisis, namely: ‘black’ OR ‘racism’ OR ‘police’ OR ‘dallas’ OR ‘alton’ OR ‘sterling’ OR ‘philando’ OR ‘castile’. We analyzed the Media factor and the Time factor separately, and more interestingly we looked at the interaction between these two factors.\nAs results, we found, first, that NYT articles were the most neutral, closely followed by Facebook posts. In contrast, tweets presented greater negativity overall. Next, we looked at topics within each time frame in each of the three sources. These topics differed across sources, even though there were also considerable overlaps. For instance, NYT articles and related tweets shared the content of their second topics, both of which revolved around ‘shooting.’ We went further to quantitatively measure any such overlaps or otherwise differences across sources. Cosine similarity—which ranges from 1, totally related, to 0, not related at all—confirmed our naked eye feeling. For instance, for the overlap between the aforementioned topics, there was a cosine similarity of .71. In contrast, a cosine of .03 came up for other comparisons, which also makes sense due to the intrinsic differences among these sources.\nLast, the interaction between Time and Source was qualitatively analyzed by means of a plot, and we found that Twitter and NYT articles were most sensitive to live developments in the crisis, whereas Facebook comments lagged behind in this immediacy. All of these findings were discussed within a framework of qualitative big data analysis.\nThe data mass probed in these analyses could be described as medium-sized data in the big data field. This field is relatively recent, and the successful, seminal examples we count on tend to feature larger sizes of data. In particular, for time frames, it is rather uncommon to find such a tight scale as we excerpted. This fact complicates the drawing of assured conclusions from our findings, because we lack well-known precedents along these lines.\n Additional materials All materials are made public on the RRisto GitHub page.\n References Ellison, R.

Inequality and confrontation about racism has extended to date, and the costs thereof have been large in terms of lives and otherwise (Feagin, 2004).","tags":["s","big data","data mining","racism","web scraping","R","API","social media","news media"],"title":"The Louisiana-Minnesota-Texas crisis across media and time: A big data exercise","type":"post"},{"authors":["Bernabeu, P., \u0026 Vogt, P."],"categories":["evolution of language"],"content":"Reference Bernabeu, P., \u0026amp; Vogt, P.

Over the  past  few decades, significant advancement has been made on the geographical and temporal origins of language, while current work is rather devoted to the underpinnings of language, in brain, genes, body, and culture of humans. Much of this literature is polarized over the crucial dichotomy of nativism  versus  emergentism.  Our  state  of  affairs  report  also  confirms  a  high  degree  of speculation,  albeit  with a  decrease  for modelling. To  tackle the  speculation  and the large research flow, we propose a more impersonal kind of review, focused on the topic’s questions rather than on particular accounts. Another observation is that novel perspectives are on the rise.  One  of  these  highlights  the  importance  of  perceptual  cognition,  often  dubbed ‘embodiment,’ in  the earlier  evolution  of language.  In  following this  lead,  we adapted  a previous experiment which had investigated the correspondence between certain perceptual features of events, and different  grammatical orders arising as participants  acted out those events. That design made a perfect basis for us to put in an additional variable, namely the contrast  between  body-based  communication  (gestures),  and  more  disembodied communication (symbol matching). Albeit tentative, the results of this pilot experiment reveal a greater effect of the embodiment variable on the grammatical preferences, which we see as inviting further exploration of embodied cognition in language evolution.","tags":["language evolution","linguistics"],"title":"Language evolution: Current status and future directions","type":"publication"}]
