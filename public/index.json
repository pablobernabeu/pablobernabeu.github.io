I use methods such as behavioural and electroencephalographic experiments, corpus analysis, statistics, and programming.\nThesis Outline\nThe linguistic and sensorimotor bases of semantic processing: An investigation into the role of individual differences\nHow do we understand the meaning of words? My PhD focuses on conceptual processing, and how individual differences affect how people understand the meaning of words. Conceptual processing has been found to draw on two cognitive systems. One is a linguistic system, based on knowledge of words and the relations among them. The other is a sensorimotor system, which draws on our perceptual, motor, and affective experience. These two systems contribute to conceptual processing in a sequential manner: the linguistic system is activated first, providing more superficial semantic information, with the sensorimotor system slower to reach peak activation, but providing more refined meaning. We know that the relative importance of each system is modulated by contextual factors (e.g., linguistic context, processing goals, cognitive resources). However, we know much less about how people’s individual cognitive capacities and experience (reading experience, reasoning ability), interact with these systems, which has become a central theme in my work.\nMuch evidence has been found in cognitive psychology for the role of linguistic systems (based on statistical regularities in how words co-occur in language) and sensorimotor systems (based on perceptual, motor, affective experience). The linguistic system is consistently linked to faster, more superficial processing, while the sensorimotor system is linked to slower, more cognitively demanding tasks (Connell \u0026amp; Lynott, 2013; Louwerse, Hutchinson, Tillman, \u0026amp; Recchia, 2015). Recent evidence suggests that individual differences, such as measures of reading experience (e.g., Pexman \u0026amp; Yap, 2018), and of sensorimotor experience (Beilock, et al., 2008; Vukovic \u0026amp; Williams, 2015), provide additional explanatory power for accounts of embodied cognition. For example, linguistic individual differences in vocabulary predict word recognition and information processing speed (Yap et al., 2012). Likewise, sensorimotor individual differences in spatial perspective-taking are also implicated in semantic processing, as participants who tend to naturally adopt an internal perspective in space are more likely to engage in perceptual simulation when reading, by identifying themselves as the protagonist (Vukovic \u0026amp; Williams, 2015).\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"After doing a research master\u0026rsquo;s in Psycholinguistics, I\u0026rsquo;m now a PhD student and graduate teaching assistant in Cognitive Psychology.

If you would like to bring any of these events to your institution at no cost, please submit a request (see Contact).\nOpen-source software Programming languages such as R and Python offer free, powerful resources for data processing, visualisation and analysis. Experience in these programs is highly valued in data-intensive disciplines.\n Open data Original data has become a public good in many research fields thanks to cultural and technological advances. On the internet, we can find innumerable data sets from sources such as scientific journals and repositories (e.g., OSF), local and national governments (e.g., London, UK [1, 2]), non-governmental organisations (e.g., data.world), etc. Researchers inside and outside academia nowadays share a lot of their data under attribution licences (e.g., Creative Commons, the UK Open Government Licence, etc.). This allows any external analysts to access these raw data, create (additional) visualisations and analyses, and share these. In society, making data more accessible can demonstrably benefit citizens (despite limitations).\n   Activities Activities comprise free workshops and datathons.\nWorkshops R is a programming language greatly equipped for the creation of reproducible documents and dashboards. Four workshops are offered that cover a suite of interrelated tools—R, R Markdown, data dashboards and Binder environments—, all underlain by reproducible workflows and open-source software.\nEach workshop includes taught and practical sections. The practice provides a chance for participants to experience and address common issues with the code. The level of taught sections is largely tailored to participants; similarly, practice sections are individually adaptable by means of easier and tougher tasks. The duration is also flexible, and some of the workshops can be combined into the same session.\nThe RStudio interface is used in all workshops. Multi-levelled, real code examples are used. Throughout the workshops, and especially in the practice sections, individual questions will be encouraged.\nWorkshop 1: Introduction to R This workshop can serve as an introduction to R or a revision. It demonstrates what can be done in R, and provides resources for individual training. Since the duration is limited, online courses are also recommended (see examples and fee waivers for full content).\n Data structures Packages: general-purpose examples (e.g., tidyverse) and more specific ones (e.g., for statistics or geography) Loading and writing data, in native and foreign formats Wide format (also dubbed ‘untidy’) versus tidy format (also dubbed ‘long’ or ‘narrow’). For most processes in R, data needs to be in a tidy format.   Image from Postma and Goedhart (2019; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000202.g001).  Combining data sets Data summaries Plots with ggplot2::ggplot() Interactive plots with plotly::ggplotly() Statistics  Linear mixed-effects models (see also a review of practices)  How functions work Debugging. Code errors are known as bugs. They can tiresome, but also interesting sometimes! 😅 Some tips for the first many years of experience include: reading and investigating error messages, in both source and console windows; controlling letter case and typos; closing parentheses and inverted commas; ensuring to have the necessary packages installed and loaded; following the format required by each function. To debug, break up code into subcomponents and test each of those to find out the source of the error. Once we act on that, the best outcome is seeing the code work, but sometimes different errors overlap, in which case we may see one error disappearing before another one appears. Debugging soon leads to proficient information seeking. The search process often begins on an internet search engine and extends to user communities, package documentation, tutorials, blogs… (see video explanation). Advanced debugging tools are also available. Vast availability of free resources on the internet, from Coursera and other MOOC sites, RStudio, University of Glasgow, Carpentries, etc. Community: StackOverflow, RStudio Community, Github issues (e.g., for R packages), etc. Using and contributing back. RStudio Cloud: a personal RStudio environment on the internet   Workshop 2: R Markdown documents Set your input and output in stone with R Markdown. These reports may be enriched with website features (HTML/CSS) and published as websites, PDF, or Word. Moreover, with R packages such as bookdown, bookdownplus, blogdown and flexdashboard, documents can be formatted into websites, digital books and data dashboards. Other useful packages include rmarkdown, knitr, kableExtra and ggplot2.\n Image from bookdownplus package (https://bookdownplus.netlify.com/portfolio/).  Workshop 3: Introduction to data dashboards Data dashboards are web applications used to visualise data in detail through tables and plots. They assist in explaining and accounting for our data processing and analysis. They don’t require any coding from the end user.\n These all-reproducible dashboards are published as websites, and thus, they can include hyperlinks and downloadable files. Some of the R packages used are knitr, kableExtra, reactable, ggplot2, plotly, rmarkdown, flexdashboard and shiny. The aim of this workshop is to practise creating different forms of dashboards—Flexdashboard and Shiny—the latter of which offers greater features, and to practise also with the hosting platforms fitting each type—such as personal websites, RPubs, Binder, Shinyapps and custom servers. A great thing about dashboards is that they may be made very simple, but they can also be taken to the next level using some HTML, CSS or Javascript code (on top of the back-end code present in the R packages used), which is addressed in the next workshop.\n Workshop 4: Binder environments and improving data dashboards Binder Binder is a tool to facilitate public access to software environments—for instance, by publishing an RStudio environment on the internet. Binder can also host Shiny apps. It is generously free for users. After looking at the nuts and bolts of a deployment, participants will be able to deploy their own Binder environments and check the result by the end of the workshop. For this purpose, it’s recommended to have data and R code ready, ideally in a GitHub repository.\n Improving data dashboards We will practise how to improve the functionality of dashboards using some HTML, CSS and Javascript code, which is the basis of websites.\n\u0026lt;!-- Javascript function to enable a hovering tooltip --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; $(document).ready(function(){ $(\u0026#39;[data-toggle=\u0026quot;tooltip1\u0026quot;]\u0026#39;).tooltip(); }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt;   Trade-offs among dashboards Next, we will practise with three dashboard types—Flexdashboard, Shiny and Flexdashboard-Shiny—and with the suitable hosting platforms. Firstly, the strength of Flexdashboard (example) is its basis on R Markdown, yielding an unmatched user interface (front-end). Secondly, the strength of Shiny (example) is the input reactivity (back-end) it offers, allowing users to download sections of data they select, in various formats. Last, Flexdashboard-Shiny (example) combines the best of both worlds.\n★  Flexdashboard  ★ ★ ★  Shiny  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★  Flexdashboard-Shiny  ★ ★ ★ Flexdashboard types are rendered as an HTML document—simple websites—, and can therefore be easily published on personal sites or RPubs. This is convenient because no special hosting is required. In contrast, Shiny and Flexdashboard-Shiny types offer greater features, but require Shiny servers. Fortunately, the shinyapps.io server is available for free, up to some usage limit. This server can host any of the three dashboards mentioned here. Another good option is presented by Binder environments, which can host the Shiny-type dashboards with no (explicit) limit. Yet, the Flexdashboard-Shiny type cannot be hosted in this server (as of January 2020, at least). Consequently, greater functionality may come at a cost for dashboards that have any considerable traffic, whereas dashboards with low traffic may do well on shinyapps.io. Knowing these trade-offs can help navigate usage limits, save on web hosting fees, and increase the availability of our dashboards online, as we can offer fall-back versions on different platforms, as in the example below:\n … preferred-dashboard (in case of downtime, please visit this alternative)\n Transforming dashboards into the different versions can be as easy as enabling or disabling some features, especially input reactivity. For instance, if we want to downgrade a Flexdashboard-Shiny to a Flexdashboard, to publish it outside of a Shiny server (see example), we must add a setting in the header of the script\nknit: (function(inputFile, encoding) { rmarkdown::render(inputFile, encoding = encoding) }) and disable reactive features\n ```r # Number of words selected on sidebar # reactive(cat(paste0(\u0026#39;Words selected below: \u0026#39;, nrow(selected_props())))) ```  Free accounts and tips App providers have specific terms of use. To begin, shinyapps.io has a free starter license with limited use, where free apps can handle a certain amount of data, and up to five apps may be created. Beyond that, RStudio offers a wide range of subscriptions starting at $9/month.\nMemory and traffic limits of the free shinyapps.io account can sometimes present problems when heavy data data sets are used, or there are many visits to the app. The memory overload issue is often flagged as Shiny cannot use on-disk bookmarking, whereas excessive traffic may see the app not loading. Fortunately, usage limits need not always require a paid subscription or a custom server, thanks to the following workarounds:\n develop app locally as far as possible, and only deploy to shinyapps.io only at the last stage; prune data set, leaving only the necessary data; if necessary, unlink data by splitting it into different sets, reducing computational demands; if necessary, use various apps (five are allowed in each free shinyapps.io account); if necessary, link from the app to a PDF with visualisations requiring heavy, interlinked data. High-resolution plots can be rendered into a PDF document in a snap, using code such as below.\n ``` pdf(\u0026#39;List of plots per page\u0026#39;, width = 13, height = 5) print(plot1) print(plot2) # ... print(plot150) dev.off() ```  Conveniently, all text in a PDF—even in plots—is indexed, so it can be searched [ Ctrl+f / Cmd+f / 🔍 ] (see example). Furthermore, you may also merge the rendered PDF with any other documents.\n  Prerequisites and suggestions for participation in each workshop Necessary: laptop or computer with R and RStudio installed, or access to RStudio Cloud; familiarity with the content of the preceding workshops through the web links herein.\nSuggested: having your own data and R code ready (on a Github repository if participating in Workshop 4); participation in some of the preceding workshops.\n  Datathons: creating reproducible documents and dashboards In these coding meet-ups, participants collaborate to create reproducible documents or dashboards using the data and software they prefer (see examples). Since the work can be split across different people and sections, some nice products may be achieved within a session. Any programming languages may be used.\n Data used: Academic or non-academic data of your own, or open-access data from sources such as OSF, scientific journals, governments, international institutions, NGOs, etc.\n Inspired by the great Reprohacks, content suggestions are encouraged. That is, if you’d like to have a reproducible document or dashboard created for a certain, open-access data set, please let us know, and some participants may take it on. Suggestions may be posted as issues or emailed to p.bernabeu@lancaster.ac.uk.  Purposes\n to visualise data in novel ways, collaboratively, and using reproducible documents or interactive dashboards. Sometimes, analysts may also draw on additional data to look at a bigger picture;\n to briefly reflect on the process by reviewing the techniques applied and challenges encountered.\n  Output: A key aspect of these meet-ups is the creation of output. Documents and dashboards are (co-)authored by the participants who work on them, who can then publish them on their websites, or on RPubs, Binder, Shinyapps or custom servers. Time constraints notwithstanding, a lot of this output may be very enticing for further development by the same participants, or even by other people if the code is shared online. Just like with data, an attribution licence can be attached to the code.\n  Prerequisites and suggestions for participation in datathons Necessary: basic knowledge of reproducible documents or dashboards.\nSuggested: familiarity with the development of reproducible documents or dashboards; an idea about the data you’d like to work with and the kind of document or dashboard you want to create.\n   Contact Please submit any queries or requests by posting an issue or emailing p.bernabeu@lancaster.ac.uk.\n ","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"c8512913ece54a96f28a968061c98dc2","permalink":"/2020/01/01/data-is-present-workshops-and-datathons/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2020/01/01/data-is-present-workshops-and-datathons/","section":"post","summary":"This project offers free activities to learn and practise reproducible data presentation across the UK.

It comes in very useful whenever doubts arise about the true origin of three or more variables. There are two main methods for performing a PCA: naive or less naive. In the naive method, you first check some conditions in your data which will determine the essentials of the analysis. In the less-naive method, you set those yourself based on whatever prior information or purposes you had. The latter method is appropriate when you already have enough information about the intercorrelations, or when you are required to select a specific number of components. I will tackle the naive method, mainly by following the guidelines in Field, Miles, and Field (2012), with updated code where necessary. A manual by Charles M. Friel (Sam Houston State University) was also useful.\nThe ‘naive’ approach is characterized by a first stage that checks whether the PCA should actually be performed with your current variables, or if some should be removed. The variables that are accepted are taken to a second stage which identifies the number of principal components that seem to underlie your set of variables.\nSTAGE 1. Determine whether PCA is appropriate at all, considering the variables  Variables should be inter-correlated enough but not too much. Field et al. (2012) provide some thresholds, suggesting that no variable should have many correlations below .30, or any correlation at all above .90. Thus, in the example here, variable Q06 should probably be excluded from the PCA.\n Bartlett’s test, on the nature of the intercorrelations, should be significant. Significance suggests that the variables are not an ‘identity matrix’ in which correlations are a sampling error.\n KMO (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin), a measure of sampling adequacy based on common variance (so similar purpose as Bartlett’s). As Field et al. review, ‘values between .5 and .7 are mediocre, values between .7 and .8 are good, values between .8 and .9 are great and values above .9 are superb’ (p. 761). There’s a general score as well as one per variable. The general one will often be good, whereas the individual scores may more likely fail. Any variable with a score below .5 should probably be removed, and the test should be run again.\n Determinant: A formula about multicollinearity. The result should preferably fall below .00001. Note that some of these tests are run on the dataframe and others on a correlation matrix of the data, as distinguished below.\n   # Necessary libraries library(ltm) library(lattice) library(psych) library(car) library(pastecs) library(scales) library(ggplot2) library(arules) library(plyr) library(Rmisc) library(GPArotation) library(gdata) library(MASS) library(qpcR) library(dplyr) library(gtools) library(Hmisc) # Select variables of interest for the PCA dataset = mydata[, c(\u0026#39;select_var1\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;select_var1\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;select_var2\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;select_var3\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;select_var4\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;select_var5\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;select_var6\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;select_var7\u0026#39;)] # Create matrix: some tests will require it data_matrix = cor(dataset, use = \u0026#39;complete.obs\u0026#39;) # See intercorrelations round(data_matrix, 2) # Bartlett\u0026#39;s cortest.bartlett(dataset) # KMO (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin) KMO(data_matrix) # Determinant det(data_matrix)   STAGE 2. Identify number of components (aka factors) In this stage, principal components (formally called ‘factors’ at this stage) are identified among the set of variables.\n The identification is done through a basic, ‘unrotated’ PCA. The number of components set a priori must equal the number of variables that are being tested.   # Start off with unrotated PCA pc1 = psych::principal(dataset, nfactors = length(dataset), rotate=\u0026quot;none\u0026quot;) pc1  Below is an example result:\n ## Principal Components Analysis ## Call: psych::principal(r = eng_prop, nfactors = 3, rotate = \u0026quot;none\u0026quot;) ## Standardized loadings (pattern matrix) based upon correlation matrix ## PC1 PC2 PC3 h2 u2 com ## Aud_eng -0.89 0.13 0.44 1 -2.2e-16 1.5 ## Hap_eng 0.64 0.75 0.15 1 1.1e-16 2.0 ## Vis_eng 0.81 -0.46 0.36 1 -4.4e-16 2.0 ## ## PC1 PC2 PC3 ## SS loadings 1.87 0.79 0.34 ## Proportion Var 0.62 0.26 0.11 ## Cumulative Var 0.62 0.89 1.00 ## Proportion Explained 0.62 0.26 0.11 ## Cumulative Proportion 0.62 0.89 1.00 ## ## Mean item complexity = 1.9 ## Test of the hypothesis that 3 components are sufficient. ## ## The root mean square of the residuals (RMSR) is 0 ## with the empirical chi square 0 with prob \u0026lt; NA ## ## Fit based upon off diagonal values = 1  Among the columns, there are first the correlations between variables and components, followed by a column (h2) with the ‘communalities’. If less factors than variables had been selected, communality values would be below 1. Then there is the uniqueness column (u2): uniqueness is equal to 1 minus the communality. Next is ‘com’, which reflects the complexity with which a variable relates to the principal components. Those components are precisely found below. The first row contains the sums of squared loadings, or eigenvalues, namely, the total variance explained by each linear component. This value corresponds to the number of units explained out of all possible factors (which were three in the above example). The rows below all cut from the same cloth. Proportion var = variance explained over a total of 1. This is the result of dividing the eigenvalue by the number of components. Multiply by 100 and you get the percentage of total variance explained, which becomes useful. In the example, 99% of the variance has been explained. Aside from the meddling maths, we should actually expect 100% there because the number of factors equaled the number of variables. Cumulative var: variance added consecutively up to the last component. Proportion explained: variance explained over what has actually been explained (only when variables = factors is this the same as Proportion var). Cumulative proportion: the actually explained variance added consecutively up to the last component (Field et al., 2012).\nAccording to Field et al. (2012), two criteria will determine the number of components to select for the next stage:\n Kaiser’s criterion: components with SS loadings \u0026gt; 1. In our example, only PC1.  A more lenient alternative is Joliffe’s criterion, SS loadings \u0026gt; .7.\n Scree plot: the number of points after point of inflexion. For this plot, call:  plot(pc1$values, type = \u0026#39;b\u0026#39;) Imagine a straight line from the first point on the right. Once this line bends considerably, count the points after the bend and up to the last point on the left. The number of points is the number of components to select. The example here is probably the most complicated (two components were finally chosen), but normally it’s not difficult.\nBased on both criteria, go ahead and select the definitive number of components.\n STAGE 3. Run definitive PCA Run a very similar command as you did before, but now with a more advanced method. The first PCA, a heuristic one, worked essentially on the inter-correlations. The definitive PCA, in contrast, will implement a prior shuffling known as ‘rotation’, to ensure that the result is robust enough (just like cards are shuffled). Explained variance is captured better this way. The go-to rotation method is the orthogonal, or ‘varimax’ (though others may be considered too).\n# Now with varimax rotation, Kaiser-normalized by default: pc2 = psych::principal(dataset, nfactors=2, rotate = \u0026quot;varimax\u0026quot;, scores = TRUE) pc2 pc2$loadings # Healthcheck pc2$residual pc2$fit pc2$communality  According to Field et al. (2012), we would want:\n Less than half of residuals with absolute values \u0026gt; 0.05 Model fit \u0026gt; .9 All communalities \u0026gt; .7  If any of this fails, consider changing the number of factors. Next, the rotated components that have been ‘extracted’ from the core of the set of variables can be added to the dataset. This would enable the use of these components as new variables that might prove powerful and useful (as in this research).\ndataset = cbind(dataset, pc2$scores) summary(dataset$RC1, dataset$RC2)  STAGE 4. Determine ascription of each variable to components Check the main summary by just calling pc2, and see how each variable correlates with the rotated components. This is essential because it reveals how variables load on each component, or in other words, to which component a variable belongs. For instance, the table shown here belongs to a study about meaning of words. These results suggest that the visual and haptic modalities of words are quite related, whereas the auditory modality is relatively unique. When the analysis works out well, a cut-off point of r = .8 may be applied for considering a variable as part of a component.\n STAGE 5. Enjoy the plot The plot is perhaps the coolest part about PCA. It really makes an awesome illustration of the power of data analysis.\n ggplot(eng_props, aes(RC1, RC2, label = as.character(main_eng))) + stat_density2d (color = \u0026quot;gray87\u0026quot;) + geom_text(size = ifelse(eng_props$word_eng %in% w_set, 12, 7), fontface = ifelse(eng_props$word_eng %in% w_set, \u0026#39;bold\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;plain\u0026#39;)) + geom_point(data=eng_props[eng_props$word_eng %in% w_set,], pch=21, fill=NA, size=14, stroke=2, alpha=.6) + labs(subtitle=\u0026#39;(Data from Lynott \u0026amp; Connell, 2009)\u0026#39;, x = \u0026quot;Varimax-rotated Principal Component 1\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Varimax-rotated Principal Component 2\u0026quot;) + theme_bw() + theme( plot.background = element_blank(), panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), panel.border = element_blank(), axis.line = element_line(color = \u0026#39;black\u0026#39;), axis.title.x = element_text(colour = \u0026#39;black\u0026#39;, size = 23, margin=margin(15,15,15,15)), axis.title.y = element_text(colour = \u0026#39;black\u0026#39;, size = 23, margin=margin(15,15,15,15)), axis.text.x = element_text(size=16), axis.text.y = element_text(size=16), plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 32, face = \u0026quot;bold\u0026quot;, margin=margin(15,15,15,15)), plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 20, margin=margin(2,15,15,15)) ) + geom_label_repel(data = eng_props[eng_props$word_eng %in% w_set,], aes(label = word_eng), size = 8, alpha = 0.77, color = \u0026#39;black\u0026#39;, box.padding = 1.5 )  Below is an example combining PCA plots with code similar to the above. These plots illustrate something further with regard to the relationships among modalities. In property words, the different modalities spread out more clearly than they do in concept words. This makes sense because in language, properties define concepts (see more).\nAn example of these analyses is available in available in this RStudio environment, in the norms.R script.\nReferences\nField, A.

The apps can be useful for both the data analyst and the public. Visualisation apps run on internet browsers. This allows for three options: private viewing (useful during analysis), selective sharing (used within work groups), or internet publication. Among the available platforms, R Shiny and Tableau stand out due to being relatively accessible to new users. Apps serve a broad variety of purposes (see this gallery and this one). In science and beyond, these apps allow us to go the extra mile in sharing data. Alongside files and code shared in repositories, we can present the data in a website, in the form of plots or tables. This facilitates the public exploration of each section of the data (groups, participants, trials…) to anyone interested, and allows researchers to account for their proceeding in the analysis.\nPublishers and journals highly encourage authors to make the most of their data by facilitating its easy exploration by the readership–even though they don’t normally offer options for hosting web visualisations yet.\nApps can also prove valuable to those analysing the data. For instance, my app helped me a lot in identifying the extent of noise in a section of the data. Instead of running through a heavy score of code, the drop-down lists of the app let me seamlessly surf through the different sections.\nAt a certain point, I found a data section that was consistently noisier than the rest, and eventually I had to discard it from further statistical analyses. Yet, instead of removing that from the app, I maintained it with a note attached. This particular trait in the data was rather salient.\nBeyond such a salient feature in the data, a visualisation app may also help to spot subtler patterns such as third variables or individual differences.\nThere are several platforms for creating apps (e.g., Tableau, D3.js, and R Shiny). I focus on R Shiny here for three reasons: it is affordable to use, fairly accessible to new users, and well suited for science as it is based on the R language (see for instance this article).\n How to Shiny Shiny apps draw on any standard R code that you may already have. This is most commonly plots or tables, but other stuff such as images or Markdown texts are valid too. This is a nice thing to keep in mind when having to create a new app. Part of the job may already be done! The app is distributed among five different areas.\n Data file(s) These are whatever data files you’re using (e.g., with csv or rds extensions).  1a. server.R script The server script contains the central processes: plots, tables, etc. Code that existed independently of the app app may be brought into this script by slightly adapting it.

Deployment and logs This script contains the commands for deploying the app on- or off-line, and for checking the session logs in case of any errors.\n 3. Automatically created folder When the app is first deployed on the internet, a subfolder is automatically created with the name ‘rsconnect’. This folder contains a text file which can be used to modify the URL and the title of the webpage.\nSteps to create a Shiny app from scratch:\n1. Tutorials (link). Being open-source software, excellent directions are available through a Google search.\nThe core ideas are:\nAs mentioned above, create a ui.R script for the code containing the user interface, and create a server.R script for the code containing the main content (your plots / tables, etc).\nAt the top of both ui.R and server.R scripts, enter the command library(shiny) and also load any other libraries you’re using (e.g., ggplot2).\nTest your app by deploying it locally, before launching online. For this purpose, first save the ui and server parts independently, as in:\n ui = shinyUI( fluidPage( # ...  Then deploy locally by running:\nshinyApp(ui, server) Managing to run the app locally is a great first step before launching online (which may sometimes prove a bit trickier).\n2. User token (link). Sign up and read in your private key—just to be done once in a computer.\n3. Go for it. After locally testing and saving the two main scripts (ui.R and server.R), run deployApp() to launch the app online.\n4. Bugs and session logs. Most often they won’t be bugs actually, but fancies, as it were. For instance, some special characters have to get even more special (technically, UTF-8 encoding). For a character such as ‘μ’, Shiny prefers ‘Âμ’, or better, the Javascript code:\nexpression(\u0026quot;\\u03bc\u0026quot;) Cling to your logs by calling the line below, which you may keep at hand in your ‘Shiny deployer.R’ script.\nshowLogs(appPath = getwd(), appFile = NULL, appName = NULL, account = NULL, entries = 50, streaming = FALSE) At best, the log output will mention any typos and unaccepted characters, pointing to specific lines in your code.\nIt may take a couple of intense days to get a first Shiny app running. Although the usual rabbit holes do exist, years of Shiny have already yielded a sizeable body of free resources online (tutorials, blogs, vlogs). Moreover, there’s also the RStudio Community, and then StackOverflow etc., where you can post any needs/despair. Post your code, log, and explanation, and you’ll be rescued out in a couple of days. Long live those contributors.\nIt’s sometimes enough to upload a bare app, but you might then think it can look better.\n5 (optional). Advance. Use tabs to combine multiple apps on one webpage, use different widgets, include a download option, etc. Tutorials like this one on Youtube can take you there, especially those that provide the code, as in the description of that video. Use those scripts as templates. For example, I made use of tabs on the top of the dashboard in order to keep the side bar from having too many widgets. The appearance of these tabs can be adjusted. More importantly, the inputs in the sidebar can be modified depending on the active tab, by means of ‘reactivity’ conditions.\n mainPanel( tags$style(HTML(\u0026#39; .tabbable \u0026gt; .nav \u0026gt; li \u0026gt; a {background-color:white; color:#3E454E} .tabbable \u0026gt; .nav \u0026gt; li \u0026gt; a:hover {background-color:#002555; color:white} .tabbable \u0026gt; .nav \u0026gt; li[class=active] \u0026gt; a {background-color:#ECF4FF; color:black} .tabbable \u0026gt; .nav \u0026gt; li[class=active] \u0026gt; a:hover {background-color:#E7F1FF; color:black} \u0026#39;)), tabsetPanel(id=\u0026#39;tabvals\u0026#39;, tabPanel(value=1, h4(strong(\u0026#39;Group \u0026amp; Electrode\u0026#39;)), br(), plotOutput(\u0026#39;plot_GroupAndElectrode\u0026#39;), h5(a(strong(\u0026#39;See plots with 95% Confidence Intervals\u0026#39;), href=\u0026#39;https://osf.io/2tpxn/\u0026#39;, target=\u0026#39;_blank\u0026#39;), style=\u0026#39;text-decoration: underline;\u0026#39;), downloadButton(\u0026#39;downloadPlot.1\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Download HD plot\u0026#39;), br(), br(), # EEG montage img(src=\u0026#39;https://preview.ibb.co/n7qiYR/EEG_montage.png\u0026#39;, height=500, width=1000)), tabPanel(value=2, h4(strong(\u0026#39;Participant \u0026amp; Area\u0026#39;)), br(), plotOutput(\u0026#39;plot_ParticipantAndLocation\u0026#39;), h5(a(strong(\u0026#39;See plots with 95% Confidence Intervals\u0026#39;), href=\u0026#39;https://osf.io/86ch9/\u0026#39;, target=\u0026#39;_blank\u0026#39;), style=\u0026#39;text-decoration: underline;\u0026#39;), downloadButton(\u0026#39;downloadPlot.2\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Download HD plot\u0026#39;), br(), br(), # EEG montage img(src=\u0026#39;https://preview.ibb.co/n7qiYR/EEG_montage.png\u0026#39;, height=500, width=1000)), tabPanel(value=3, h4(strong(\u0026#39;Participant \u0026amp; Electrode\u0026#39;)), br(), plotOutput(\u0026#39;plot_ParticipantAndElectrode\u0026#39;), br(), downloadButton(\u0026#39;downloadPlot.3\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Download HD plot\u0026#39;), br(), br(), # EEG montage img(src=\u0026#39;https://preview.ibb.co/n7qiYR/EEG_montage.png\u0026#39;, height=500, width=1000)), tabPanel(value=4, h4(strong(\u0026#39;OLD Group \u0026amp; Electrode\u0026#39;)), br(), plotOutput(\u0026#39;plot_OLDGroupAndElectrode\u0026#39;), h5(a(strong(\u0026#39;See plots with 95% Confidence Intervals\u0026#39;), href=\u0026#39;https://osf.io/dvs2z/\u0026#39;, target=\u0026#39;_blank\u0026#39;), style=\u0026#39;text-decoration: underline;\u0026#39;), downloadButton(\u0026#39;downloadPlot.4\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Download HD plot\u0026#39;), br(), br(), # EEG montage img(src=\u0026#39;https://preview.ibb.co/n7qiYR/EEG_montage.png\u0026#39;, height=500, width=1000)) ),  The official Shiny gallery offers a great array of apps including their code (e.g., basic example).

For instance, we can link back to the data repository, where the code for the app can be found.\nAn example of a Shiny app is available, which may also be edited and run in this RStudio environment, inside the ‘Shiny-app’ folder.\nThe Shiny server (shinyapps.io) allows publishing dashboards built with various frameworks besides Shiny proper. Flexdashboard and Shinydashboard are two of these frameworks, which have visible advantages over basic Shiny, in terms of layout. An example with Flexdashboard is available.\n★  Flexdashboard  ★ ★ ★  Shiny  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★  Flexdashboard-Shiny  ★ ★ ★   Logistics Memory capacity can become an issue as you go on, which will be flagged in the error logs as: ‘Shiny cannot use on-disk bookmarking’. This doesn’t necessarily lead you to a paid subscription or to host the website on a custom server. Try pruning the data file, outsourcing data sections across the five available apps.\nApp providers have specific terms of use. To begin, Shiny has a free starter license with limited use, where free apps can handle a certain amount of data, and up to five apps may be created. Beyond that, RStudio offers a wide range of subscriptions starting at $9/month. For its part, Tableau in principle deals only with subscriptions from $35/month on. While they offer 1-year licenses to students and instructors for free, these don’t include web hosting, unlike Shiny’s free plan. Further comparisons of these platforms are available online. Last, I’ll just mention a third language, D3, which is powerful, and may also be used through R.\nIn the case of very heavy data or frequent public use, if you don’t want to host your Shiny app externally, you might consider rendering a PDF with your visualisations instead.\n pdf(\u0026quot;List of plots per page\u0026quot;, width=13, height=5) print(plot1) print(plot2) # ... print(plot150) dev.off()  High-resolution plots can be rendered into a PDF document in a snap. Conveniently, all text is indexed, so it can be searched (Ctrl+f / Cmd+f / 🔍) (see example). Furthermore, you may also merge the rendered PDF with any other documents.\nSummary in slides available.\nFeel free to share any thoughts or questions in a comment below.\n ","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"f9413c62b86d03e75af694d4da6355a8","permalink":"/2017/01/01/the-case-for-data-dashboards.-first-steps-with-r-shiny/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2017/01/01/the-case-for-data-dashboards.-first-steps-with-r-shiny/","section":"post","summary":"Dashboards for data visualisation, such as R Shiny and Tableau, allow the interactive exploration of data by means of drop-down lists and checkboxes, with no coding required from the final users. The apps can be useful for both the data analyst and the public. Visualisation apps run on internet browsers. This allows for three options: private viewing (useful during analysis), selective sharing (used within work groups), or internet publication. Among the available platforms, R Shiny and Tableau stand out due to being relatively accessible to new users. Apps serve a broad variety of purposes. In science and beyond, these apps allow us to go the extra mile in sharing data. Alongside files and code shared in repositories, we can present the data in a website, in the form of plots or tables. This facilitates the public exploration of each section of the data (groups, participants, trials...) to anyone interested, and allows researchers to account for their proceeding in the analysis.","tags":["data presentation","dashboard","reproducibility","open science","open data","R","Shiny","Flexdashboard"],"title":"The case for data dashboards.
