<p>This document is part of teaching materials created for the workshop <a href="https://github.com/pablobernabeu/CarpentryCon-2020-workshop-Open-Data-Reproducibility" target="_top">‘Open data and reproducibility v2.1: R Markdown, dashboards and Binder’</a>, delivered at the <a href="https://2020.carpentrycon.org/">CarpentryCon 2020 conference</a>. The purpose of this specific document is to practise R Markdown, including basic features such as Markdown markup and code chunks, along with more special features such as <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/cross-ref.html">cross-references for figures, tables, code chunks, etc</a>.

      <h6 class="card-subtitle">Postdoctoral fellow at UiT &ndash; <br>The Arctic University of Norway</h6>
      <p class="card-text">After doing a research master's, I became a PhD student and graduate teaching assistant in Psychology at Lancaster University, where I investigated how conceptual processing&mdash;that is, the comprehension of the meaning of words&mdash;is supported by linguistic and sensorimotor brain systems, and how research on this topic is influenced by methodological aspects such as the operationalisation of variables and the sample size of experiments. Currently, I am a postdoctoral fellow at UiT The Arctic University of Norway, where I am investigating the behavioural and neural underpinnings of multilingualism. Throughout my research, I have used methods such as behavioural and electroencephalographic experiments, corpus analysis, statistics and programming.
