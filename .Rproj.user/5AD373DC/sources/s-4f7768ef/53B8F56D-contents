### **Thesis** 

#### The linguistic and sensorimotor bases of semantic processing: An investigation into the role of individual differences

How do we understand the meaning of words? My PhD focuses on conceptual processing, and how individual differences affect how people understand the meaning of words. Conceptual processing has been found to draw on two cognitive systems. One is a linguistic system, based on knowledge of words and the relations among them. The other is a sensorimotor system, which draws on our perceptual, motor, and affective experience. These two systems contribute to conceptual processing in a sequential manner: the linguistic system is activated first, providing more superficial semantic information, with the sensorimotor system slower to reach peak activation, but providing more refined meaning. We know that the relative importance of each system is modulated by contextual factors (e.g., linguistic context, processing goals, cognitive resources). However, we know much less about how peopleâ€™s individual cognitive capacities and experience (reading experience, reasoning ability), interact with these systems, which has become a central theme in my work. 

Much evidence has been found in cognitive psychology for the role of linguistic systems (based on statistical regularities in how words co-occur in language) and sensorimotor systems (based on perceptual, motor, affective experience). The linguistic system is consistently linked to faster, more superficial processing, while the sensorimotor system is linked to slower, more cognitively demanding tasks (Connell & Lynott, 2013; Louwerse, Hutchinson, Tillman, & Recchia, 2015). Recent evidence suggests that individual differences, such as measures of reading experience (e.g., Pexman & Yap, 2018), and of sensorimotor experience (Beilock, et al., 2008; Vukovic & Williams, 2015), provide additional explanatory power for accounts of embodied cognition. For example, linguistic individual differences in vocabulary predict word recognition and information processing speed (Yap et al., 2012). Likewise, sensorimotor individual differences in spatial perspective-taking are also implicated in semantic processing, as participants who tend to naturally adopt an internal perspective in space are more likely to engage in perceptual simulation when reading, by identifying themselves as the protagonist (Vukovic & Williams, 2015).
