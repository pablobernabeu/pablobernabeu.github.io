abstract: 'We tested whether conceptual processing is modality-specific by tracking the time course of the Conceptual Modality Switch effect. Forty-six participants verified the relation between property words and concept words. The conceptual modality of consecutive trials was manipulated in order to produce an Auditory-to-visual switch condition, a Haptic-to-visual switch condition, and a Visual-to-visual, no-switch condition. Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) were time-locked to the onset of the first word (property) in the target trials so as to measure the effect online and to avoid a within-trial confound. A switch effect was found, characterized by more negative ERP amplitudes for modality switches than no-switches. It proved significant in four typical time windows from 160 to 750 milliseconds post word onset, with greater strength in the Slow group, in posterior brain regions, and in the N400 window. The earliest switch effect was located in the language brain region, whereas later it was more prominent in the visual region. In the N400 and Late Positive windows, the Quick group presented the effect especially in the language region, whereas the Slow had it rather in the visual region. These results suggest that contextual factors such as time resources modulate the engagement of linguistic and embodied systems in conceptual processing.'

**Content**

The data is from a psychology experiment on the comprehension of words, in which electroencephalographic (EEG) responses were measured. The data are presented in plots spanning 800 milliseconds (the duration of word processing). The aim of this Shiny app is to facilitate the exploration of the data by researchers and the public. Users can delve into the different sections of the data. In a hierarchical order, these sections are groups of participants, individual participants, brain areas, and electrodes.

**Shiny apps in science**

By creating this app, I tried to reach beyond the scope of current _open science_, which is often confined to files shared on data repositories. I believe that Shiny apps will become general practice in science within a few years ([see blog post or slides for more information](http://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/activities/presenting-data-interactively-online-using-r-shiny(c9ce06ac-987e-4141-9121-016f6ee6d16b).html)).


**Technical details**

I made use of tabs on the top of the dashboard in order to keep the side bar from having too many widgets. I adjusted the appearance of these tabs, and by means of 'reactivity' conditions, also modified the inputs in the sidebar depending on the active tab.

```
mainPanel(

	tags$style(HTML('
	    .tabbable > .nav > li > a                  		{background-color:white; color:#3E454E}
	    .tabbable > .nav > li > a:hover            		{background-color:#002555; color:white}
	    .tabbable > .nav > li[class=active] > a 		{background-color:#ECF4FF; color:black}
	    .tabbable > .nav > li[class=active] > a:hover	{background-color:#E7F1FF; color:black}
	')),

	tabsetPanel(id='tabvals',

            tabPanel(value=1, h4(strong('Group & Electrode')), br(), plotOutput('plot_GroupAndElectrode'),
			h5(a(strong('See plots with 95% Confidence Intervals'), href='https://osf.io/2tpxn/',
			target='_blank'), style='text-decoration: underline;'), 
			downloadButton('downloadPlot.1', 'Download HD plot'), br(), br(),
			# EEG montage
			img(src='https://preview.ibb.co/n7qiYR/EEG_montage.png', height=500, width=1000)),

            tabPanel(value=2, h4(strong('Participant & Area')), br(), plotOutput('plot_ParticipantAndLocation'),
			h5(a(strong('See plots with 95% Confidence Intervals'), href='https://osf.io/86ch9/',
			target='_blank'), style='text-decoration: underline;'), 
			downloadButton('downloadPlot.2', 'Download HD plot'), br(), br(),
			# EEG montage
			img(src='https://preview.ibb.co/n7qiYR/EEG_montage.png', height=500, width=1000)),

            tabPanel(value=3, h4(strong('Participant & Electrode')), br(), plotOutput('plot_ParticipantAndElectrode'),
			br(), downloadButton('downloadPlot.3', 'Download HD plot'), br(), br(),
			# EEG montage
			img(src='https://preview.ibb.co/n7qiYR/EEG_montage.png', height=500, width=1000)),

            tabPanel(value=4, h4(strong('OLD Group & Electrode')), br(), plotOutput('plot_OLDGroupAndElectrode'),
			h5(a(strong('See plots with 95% Confidence Intervals'), href='https://osf.io/dvs2z/',
			target='_blank'), style='text-decoration: underline;'), 
			downloadButton('downloadPlot.4', 'Download HD plot'), br(), br(),
			# EEG montage
			img(src='https://preview.ibb.co/n7qiYR/EEG_montage.png', height=500, width=1000))
	),
```

The data set was fairly large, considering the fact that it's hosted with the free plan. In order to lighten the processing, I split the data into various files, reducing the total size. Furthermore, I outsourced a particularly heavy set of plots (those with Confidence Intervals) to PDF files, to which I linked in the app. 

```
h5(a(strong('See plots with 95% Confidence Intervals'), href='https://osf.io/dvs2z/',
			target='_blank'), style='text-decoration: underline;'),
```

I also used web links to the published paper and raw data, as well as to the _server_ and _ui_ scripts. These files, along with the data, are publicly available [in this repository](https://osf.io/97unm/); they may be accessed within the "Files" section, by opening the folders "ERPs" -> "Analyses of ERPs averaged across trials" -> "Shiny app".

Another feature I added was the download button.

**_Easy to laugh now!_**

My experience with Shiny has been so good I've been sharing my experience. Yet, on my first crawling days, I spent an eternity stuck with this elephant in my room: "μ". This _μ_ letter (micro-souvenir from hell, as I later knew it), was part of the labels of my plots. All I knew was that I could not deploy the app online, even while I could perfectly launch it locally in my laptop. So, I wondered what use was to deploy locally if I couldn't publish the app?! Eventually, I read about UTF-8 encoding in one forum. Bless them forums. All I had to do was use "Âμ" instead of the single "μ". A better option I found later was: `expression("\u03bc")`.

Beyond encoding issues, I had a tough time embedding images. You know, the 'www' folder... To be honest, I still haven't handled the 'www' way--but where there's a will there's a way. I managed to include my images by uploading them to a website and then entering their URL in "img(src", avoiding the use of folder paths.

```
img(src="https://preview.ibb.co/n7qiYR/EEG_montage.png 1", height=500, width=1000)
```

Long after I had built the app, I added another image--the _favicon_ (the little icon on the browser tab). 

```
tags$head(tags$link(rel="shortcut icon", href="https://image.ibb.co/fXUwzb/favic.png")),  # web favicon
```
